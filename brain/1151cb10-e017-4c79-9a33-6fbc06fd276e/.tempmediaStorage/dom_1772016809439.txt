	Since you don't have any classes today, it's a great opportunity to catch up on your coursework. I would recommend reviewing the course materials for GEX1015/GET1029, as the midterm exam is approaching. You can also use this time to get ahead on assignments and review any notes or readings that are due soon.

Additionally, you might want to consider signing up for a coaching session in BT1101 if you need additional support. The sign-up recess week is ongoing, so it's a good chance to get some extra help if you need it.

How does that sound?
