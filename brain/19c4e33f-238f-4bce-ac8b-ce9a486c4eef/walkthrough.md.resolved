# Today's Agenda Walkthrough

The Dashboard's "Today's Schedule" has been upgraded to a more comprehensive **Today's Agenda**. This new view combines your classes, tasks due today, and assignments due today into a single, chronologically sorted timeline.

## Changes Made

### 📅 Unified Timeline
- Interleaves classes, tasks, and assignments based on their scheduled or due times.
- Maintains the existing chronological sorting and visual hierarchy.
- Replaces the standalone "Today's Schedule" section with the new "Today's Agenda".

### ✏️ Polymorphic Rendering
- **Classes**: Retain their original styling, including course colors and active/upcoming status indicators.
- **Tasks**: Display clearly with their priority-colored status dots and interactive completion toggles.
- **Assignments**: Show with high-visibility urgency markers and submission status toggles.

### 🔄 Fully Interactive
- You can mark tasks as complete or toggle assignment submission status directly from the agenda view.
- Timetable attendance toggles and venues are still easily accessible.
