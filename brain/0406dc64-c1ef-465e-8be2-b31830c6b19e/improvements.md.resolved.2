# Proposed Improvements for CraftCanvas

After reviewing the current implementation of the Academic Life OS, I've identified several areas where we can elevate the experience, focusing on academic success and the unique "Dense Terminal" aesthetic.

## 1. AI-Powered Academic Companion
Currently, the AI handles chat and daily briefs well. We can extend this into active learning:
- **Active Recall (Quiz Mode)**: Generate multiple-choice or short-answer questions directly from the synced Canvas course files and announcements.
- **Smart Flashcards**: Automatically generate flashcards from lecture notes. We could integrate with Anki or build a simple terminal-style flashcard viewer in the app.
- **Semantic File Search**: Enhance the `/ai` session to allow searching through the content of all downloaded PDFs/PPTs from Canvas using the existing RAG pipeline.

## 2. Immersive Focus Environment
The Focus Mode is a great start. We can make it a truly world-class productivity space:
- **Ambient Soundscape**: Integrate a built-in audio player with curated, desaturated soundscapes (Lo-Fi, Heavy Rain, Busy NUS Library).
- **Post-Session Reflection**: After a focus session ends, have the AI prompt a 30-second reflection: *"What was the most challenging part of this task?"* to help with metacognition.
- **Picture-in-Picture (PiP) Timer**: Allow the focus timer to pop out into a small PiP window so you can see your progress while working in other apps.

## 3. Academic Analytics & Visibility
Make the "Life OS" more proactive about your academic standing:
- **Grade Simulator / CAP Tracker**: Build a view that predicts your final grade/CAP based on current scores and weighted averages. *"What do I need in the final exam to get an A?"*
- **Workload Heatmap**: A visualization that combines your NUSMods timetable with upcoming Assignment deadlines to identify "crunch weeks" before they happen.

## 4. UI/UX "Dense Terminal" Polish
Lean harder into the Terminal aesthetic for a more premium feel:
- **Command Palette (Cmd+K)**: Implement a powerful keyboard-centric palette for jumping between modules, creating tasks, or triggering AI commands without touching the mouse.
- **CRT / Terminal Effects**: Add an optional toggle for subtle CRT scanlines, flicker, and a slight screen glow to match the "Dense Terminal" vibe.
- **Typographic Micro-animations**: Use subtle typing animations for AI responses and "data stream" effects when syncing with Canvas.

## 5. Telegram Bot 2.0 (Interactive)
The current bot is great for quick capture. We can make it an interactive command center:
- **Interactive Checklist**: Send `/tasks` and get a message with inline toggle buttons to mark tasks as done without typing.
- **Voice-to-Task**: Send a voice note to the bot; it uses Whisper (via local Ollama or API) to transcribe and then parses the task automatically.
- **Assignment Reminders**: Not just a daily brief, but a gentle nudge 4 hours before a deadline with a specific "Get Started" link.

## 6. Deeper Craft Ecosystem Integration
Move beyond just pushing a daily note:
- **Bi-directional Task Sync**: If you check a task in Craft, the backend detects the update (via Craft API polling) and marks it as done in SQLite.
- **Module Wiki Auto-Generation**: Automatically build a "Module Wiki" in Craft for each course, linking lecture summaries, assignments, and AI-generated study guides into a structured folder hierarchy.
- **Meeting Minutes to Tasks**: If you record a project meeting in Craft, the AI can scan the new content and suggest new tasks for your Academic OS inbox.

## 7. Intelligent Workflow Automation
Reduce the administrative burden of being a student:
- **Auto-Email Drafts**: When a new announcement is posted about a "Missing Grade" or "Project Submission", the AI drafts a polite inquiry email for you to review and send.
- **Conflict Resolver**: The system identifies when a task's estimated time exceeds your free blocks in the NUSMods timetable and suggests moving the task or "Focusing" during a specific gap.

## 8. Local Social & Collaborative OS
Since this is self-hosted on a tunnel, we can add "Presence" and "Shared Study" features:
- **Study-Together Mode**: Allow a friend (also on CraftCanvas) to "Join" your focus session. Both see each other's timers and a minimal "Presence" indicator (Mono labels: `[OLI: FOCUSING] [FRIEND: BREAK]`).
- **Shared Flashcard Decks**: Build a local "Marketplace" or simple P2P sync to share the smart flashcards we generated from lecture notes.
- **Project Team Room**: A dedicated "Module Detail" sub-page for group projects where tasks can be assigned to team members and synced to a shared Craft page.

## 9. Hardware & Ambient Integration
Integrate the "Academic OS" into your physical environment:
- **Smart Light Sync (Home Assistant)**: Integrate with local smart lights to turn them "Red" during focus mode and "Green" during breaks automatically (via Webhooks).
- **Physical "Focus Button"**: Support for a USB/Bluetooth physical button to start/stop the focus timer, pushing a purely tactical interface.
- **Mac Menu Bar / Desktop Widget**: A tiny companion app (or just a transparent Electron window) that stays on the desktop, mirroring the "Dense Terminal" metadata stream.

## 10. Long-Term Academic Portfolio
Transform from a "Management Tool" to a "Growth Tool":
- **Skill Tree Visualization**: Map module credits and grades to a "Skill Tree" (e.g., Computer Systems, Math, Soft Skills) to see your academic evolution over 4 years.
- **Automatic Portfolio Builder**: At the end of a semester, the AI selects your "Best Work" (top-graded assignments and project notes) and generates a markdown portfolio/resume page.
- **CAP Projection & Goal Setting**: Set target grades for the next 2 years and let the system calculate the required GPA per semester to reach your goal.
