# Redesigned Today's Schedule Dashboard Section

The "Today's Schedule" module on the Dashboard has been reimagined as a dynamic vertical timeline that offers a better sense of time progression.

## Changes Made
- **[MODIFY] [app/page.tsx](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/app/page.tsx)**: Replaced the old list format in the "Today's Schedule" section with a vertical timeline view.

## Visual Upgrades
- **Past Classes**: Items whose end time has passed are now desaturated (`grayscale-[0.3]`) and faded (`opacity-60`) to recede into the background. Their timeline marker is now a hollow ring.
- **Active Class**: Now highlighted with a subtle background (`bg-accent/5`) and colored border, a glowing/pinging timeline dot, and a live progress bar at the bottom showing how much of the class has elapsed.
- **Upcoming Items**: Classes starting within 60 minutes are subtly flagged with an urgency background (`bg-urgency/10`) and dynamic "in Xm" text instead of strict start/end times.
- **Timeline Rail**: A subtle vertical divider (`bg-border/60`) now anchors all elements and connects them chronologically.

## Verification
- Code has been written.
- The development server has hot-reloaded the changes. 

Please take a look at the dashboard at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and ensure the new timeline aesthetic is to your liking!
