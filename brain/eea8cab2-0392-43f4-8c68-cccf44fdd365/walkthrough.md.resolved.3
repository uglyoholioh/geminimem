# Assignments Page Redesign v6 (Minimalist)

We have simplified the Assignments page to match the elegant, clean aesthetics of the Tasks and Timetable pages. The heavy boards and grids are gone, replaced by a calm, structured list.

## Key Features

### 1. Minimalist List View
- Assignments are now displayed in a highly readable vertical list ([AssignmentRow](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/app/assignments/page.tsx#286-342)).
- Generous padding, subtle borders, and precise typography keep the interface uncluttered.
- Module codes are displayed as small, muted pill badges on the left.
- Points and relative due dates align neatly on the right.

### 2. Time-Based Grouping
- Assignments are automatically categorized into logical, time-based sections:
  - **Overdue** (pulsing red highlight for urgency)
  - **Next 7 Days** 
  - **Later**
  - **Completed** (can be toggled in the filters)

### 3. Integrated Filtering
- Seamlessly works with the existing **Module Chips**.
- The **Advanced Filters** panel lets you trim down the list by specific criteria (e.g., minimum points).

### 4. Interactive State
- Clicking anywhere on a row instantly opens the right-side detail panel.
- A single click on the inline circle/check icon toggles the assignment rapidly between 'in progress' and 'submitted'.

## Verification

Please open [http://localhost:3000/assignments](http://localhost:3000/assignments) in your browser:

1. Observe the structured **Minimalist List** layout.
2. Note the logical time-based groupings (Overdue, Next 7 Days).
3. Try clicking the inline status circle on the far right of an assignment row to toggle it instantly.
4. Click on any row to open the detailed editing panel.

This layout maximizes readability and removes visual noise, letting you focus entirely on your work.
