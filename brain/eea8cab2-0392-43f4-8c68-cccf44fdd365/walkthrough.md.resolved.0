# Assignments Page Refactor

The assignments page has been significantly enhanced to improve space utilization, provide better scannability, and add powerful filtering & search capabilities. You no longer have to stare at one gigantic list of assignments!

## Changes Made

### 1. Header Toolbar
- Added a responsive **Search Bar** to instantly filter assignments by their title or module code.
- Added a **Status Dropdown** filter (All Statuses, Not Started, In Progress, Submitted, Graded) right inside the header, next to the search bar.

### 2. Layout & Density Improvements
- Reduced the vertical padding and gap in the list items (now using `px-3 py-2`).
- Re-organized the assignment metadata (course code, points, due date, status) into a single horizontal row on desktop to drastically reduce the vertical height of each card.
- The UI now feels much more compact, allowing you to see significantly more assignments at a glance.

### 3. Smart Grouping by Urgency
- Instead of one endless list, the default "All" and "Upcoming" views now intelligently group your assignments by urgency:
  - **Overdue**
  - **Due Next 7 Days**
  - **Due Later**
  - **No Due Date**
- This provides immediate context on what needs your attention right now versus what can wait.

## Verification

Please open [http://localhost:3000/assignments](http://localhost:3000/assignments) in your browser:

1. Look at the new denser layout for the assignment cards.
2. Verify the new search bar works: try searching for an assignment title or module code.
3. Test the status dropdown to ensure the list filters correctly.
4. Check that assignments in the default view are grouped properly by urgency headers (`OVERDUE`, `DUE NEXT 7 DAYS`, etc.).
