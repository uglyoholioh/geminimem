# Assignments UX and Logic Improvements

We have significantly enhanced the Assignments page with a more interactive and logical experience, inspired by high-end personal productivity apps.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Hover-to-preview Detail Panel
- **Quick Peek**: Simply hover your cursor over any assignment to see its details instantly in the right panel.
- **Pin to Edit**: Click an assignment to "pin" it open, allowing you to edit notes, status, and track hours.
- **Fluid Experience**: The interface responds instantly to your focus, reducing the need for excessive clicking.

### 2. Logical Sorting & Grouping
The list is now organized by priority to help you focus on what's actionable:
- **Action Needed**: Highlights assignments that are already overdue or due within the next 48 hours.
- **Upcoming**: Shows what's coming up in the next 14 days.
- **Backlog**: Keeps track of assignments with no due date or those further out in the future.
- **Completed**: Easily accessible via the "Showing/Hiding Completed" toggle.

### 3. Smart Filtering
- **Focus on Active Work**: Assignments from inactive modules are now automatically hidden from the list and filter chips.
- **Clean Interface**: The "Min Points" filter has been removed to keep the advanced options focused and simple.
- **Dynamic Headers**: Totals and filter states update in real-time as you search and toggle modules.

## Verification

Please open [http://localhost:3000/assignments](http://localhost:3000/assignments) to see the changes:

1. **Hover over assignments**: Notice how the preview panel appears automatically.
2. **Click an assignment**: The panel transitions to "Assignment Details" and becomes editable.
3. **Check the groupings**: See how assignments are sorted into "Action Needed" vs "Upcoming".
4. **Toggle Module Inactivity**: Confirm that assignments from inactive courses no longer appear.

These refinements create a more intuitive workflow, ensuring you always know exactly what to work on next.
