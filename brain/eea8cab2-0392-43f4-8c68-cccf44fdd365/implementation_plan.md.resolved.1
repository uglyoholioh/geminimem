# Assignments Layout & Collapsible Sections

The user requested different ways to view assignments (List, Grid, Timeline) and the ability to collapse sections.

## Proposed Changes

### Frontend
#### [MODIFY] [page.tsx](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/app/assignments/page.tsx)
- **State Additions**:
  - `layoutLayout` (`'list' | 'grid' | 'timeline'`): To track the current visual layout mode. Default to `'timeline'`.
  - `collapsedGroups` (`Set<string>`): To track which urgency groups (e.g., 'Overdue', 'Due Today') are currently collapsed.
- **Header Updates**:
  - Add a "View Toggle" segmented control (using icons like `LayoutList`, `LayoutGrid`, `GitCommit` from lucide-react) to switch between the three layouts.
- **Section Headers**:
  - Update the urgency group headers (e.g., `<h3>{groupName}</h3>`) to be clickable buttons that toggle the `collapsedGroups` set.
  - Add a chevron icon (`ChevronDown` / `ChevronUp`) to indicate the collapsed state.
- **Layout Implementations**:
  - **Timeline Mode (`timeline`)**: Keep the existing vertical timeline with dots and connector lines.
  - **Grid Mode (`grid`)**: Restore the card-based grid layout (`grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 xl:grid-cols-3 2xl:grid-cols-4`).
  - **List Mode (`list`)**: Implement a new, highly dense row layout. This will be a flat list where metadata (module code, title, status, points, due date) is aligned horizontally to maximize vertical space.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
1. I will implement the changes and the frontend dev server will hot-reload.
2. The user will be asked to navigate to [/assignments](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/app/assignments) on their local instance (`localhost:3000/assignments`).
3. User to verify:
   - Does the view toggle correctly switch between List, Grid, and Timeline modes?
   - Can sections be collapsed and expanded by clicking their headers?
   - Does the new List layout provide a dense, scannable view?
