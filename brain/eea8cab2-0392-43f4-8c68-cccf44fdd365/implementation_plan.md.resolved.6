# Assignments UX and Logic Improvements

The user requested several user experience and logic improvements to the Minimalist Assignments list to make it function more like a high-end application.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Hover-to-preview Detail Panel
- **Frontend ([page.tsx](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/app/notes/page.tsx))**:
  - Introduce a `hovered` state to track the assignment currently under the cursor.
  - While hovering an assignment row, the right-side detail panel will temporarily display its information.
  - Moving the cursor away clears the preview.
  - Clicking an assignment "pins" it (as it works currently), keeping the detail panel permanently open and fetching its full description.

### 2. Logical Sorting & Grouping
We will redesign the grouping logic to present what the user cares about most:
- **Action Needed**: Assignments that are Overdue OR Due within 48 hours. (Sorted: Earliest due first, then highest points).
- **Upcoming**: Assignments due within the next 14 days. (Sorted: Earliest due first).
- **Backlog**: Assignments with no due date, or due further than 14 days out. (Sorted: Highest points first).
- **Completed**: Submitted or Graded assignments.

### 3. Hiding Inactive Modules
- **Backend ([routers/assignments.py](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/backend/routers/assignments.py))**:
  - Update the [list_assignments](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/backend/routers/assignments.py#58-94) endpoint to omit any assignments belonging to courses where `is_active` is false.
  - This ensures hidden modules disappear completely from the list and from the module filter chips.

### 4. Simplified Filtering
- **Frontend ([page.tsx](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/app/notes/page.tsx))**:
  - Remove the "Min Points" input from the advanced filtering menu as requested.

## User Review Required
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please review the logical sorting categories above (Action Needed, Upcoming, Backlog). Let me know if these timeframes and priorities align with how you want to see your work!

## Verification Plan
1. Update [routers/assignments.py](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/backend/routers/assignments.py) to filter by active courses.
2. Update [page.tsx](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/app/notes/page.tsx) states (`hovered` vs `selected`).
3. Refactor the `groupedAssignments` useMemo hook for the new logical sorting.
4. Test hover preview, clicking to pin, and check that hidden courses are gone.
