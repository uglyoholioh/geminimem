# Assignments Page Redesign v4 (Ideation)

The user has decided to move away from the Kanban board layout in search of a system that better aligns with the overall user experience and how a student might best view their assignments.

## Proposed Layout Paradigms

We have generated 3 distinct concepts using Stitch to explore different ways to visualize this data:

1. **Minimalist Vertical Timeline**: Focuses purely on chronological urgency. Distinct headers for "Due Today", "This Week", and "Later". Strips away "cards" in favor of clean, dense, horizontal rows. Very fast to scan.
2. **Eisenhower Productivity Matrix**: A 2x2 dashboard sorting tasks by Urgency (X) and Impact/Points (Y). Useful for students who need help deciding *what* to work on next, not just when it is due.
3. **Bento Box Dashboard**: A visually engaging, Apple-style masonry grid. High-priority assignments are larger, prominent tiles; completed ones are smaller, muted tiles. Focuses on a premium, data-rich but beautiful user experience.

## User Review Required

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The user needs to review the generated Stitch project and select one of the paradigms (or a combination) before we proceed to implementation.

## Implementation Steps (Pending Selection)
1. Review user feedback on Stitch concepts.
2. Update this implementation plan with concrete structural and styling changes for [page.tsx](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/app/notes/page.tsx).
3. Receive user approval on the finalized plan.
4. Execute frontend code modifications and verify.
