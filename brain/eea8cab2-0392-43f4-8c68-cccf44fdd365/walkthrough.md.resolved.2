# Assignments Page Redesign v4 (Bento Box Edition)

We have successfully replaced the Kanban board with a premium **Bento Box Dashboard**. This layout utilizes a dynamic masonry-style grid that prioritizes your work based on urgency and impact.

## Key Features

### 1. Dynamic Bento Grid
- **Needs Attention Section**: Focuses on assignments that are Not Started or In Progress.
- **Dynamic Sizing**: 
  - **Critical tasks** (High points + Due within 3 days) are large, prominent tiles covering multiple rows/columns.
  - **Urgent tasks** are wide tiles to catch your attention.
  - **Standard tasks** stay as compact tiles to maintain a clean aesthetic.

### 2. Interactive Urgency Cues
- Overdue and imminent tasks have distinct **colored glows** and pulsating timers.
- Glassmorphic translucency for a modern, high-end "OS" feel.

### 3. Integrated Filtering
- Seamlessly works with the existing **Module Chips** and **Advanced Filters**.
- Includes a toggle to show/hide the **Completed** section at the bottom.

## Verification

Please open [http://localhost:3000/assignments](http://localhost:3000/assignments) in your browser:

1. Observe the **Bento Grid** layout.
2. Note how larger tiles represent more urgent or important (high point) assignments.
3. Toggle modules and filters to see the grid dynamically reflow.
4. Click on any tile to open the detailed editing panel.

This layout provides a much more intuitive and visually pleasing "status at a glance" experience than the traditional kanban or list views.
