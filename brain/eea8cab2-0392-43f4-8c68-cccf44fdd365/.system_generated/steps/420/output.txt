The layout is a 2x2 grid with four quadrants: 'Urgent & Important' (Top Left), 'Less Urgent & Important' (Top Right), 'Urgent & Less Important' (Bottom Left), and 'Less Urgent & Less Important' (Bottom Right). Each quadrant contains minimalist, condensed horizontal task strips with glassmorphic backgrounds. 'Urgent & Important' uses vibrant red/amber accents for high-priority signaling. Each strip displays the Module Code (e.g., CS101), Assignment Name, and Points.
