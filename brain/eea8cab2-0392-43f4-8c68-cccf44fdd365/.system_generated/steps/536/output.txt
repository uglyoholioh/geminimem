The layout is a clean, structured list with generous padding and subtle, thin borders between rows. Each row displays: a muted Module Code badge (e.g., CS101), the Assignment Title in a clear sans-serif font, the Precise Due Date (e.g., Oct 24, 11:59 PM), and the Points value. There is no visual clutter—no heavy shadows or vibrant glows. The sidebar is simple and recessed. A 'View as' toggle at the top allows switching between 'List' and 'Calendar' but defaults to this elegant list. variant 1 of 2.\nPlatform: web\nForm factor: desktop","name":"projects/10118471738337248464/screens/00b3608238204e8c996736534d58580a","theme":{"colorMode":"DARK","font":"INTER","roundness":"ROUND_EIGHT","customColor":"#3617cf","saturation":2},"deviceType":"DESKTOP","screenType":"DESIGN","screenMetadata":{"agentType":"PRO_AGENT","status":"COMPLETE"}},{"screenshot":{"name":"projects/10118471738337248464/files/2551c83ae43544208e518467d73151cd","downloadUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/aida/AOfcidWyBLKUgOvUPPyImqc3o3-BCH37uk6en2VRtdbALmSEfVyiFRPMoeiCWYlf9SV-dWuDdTQ3YYoFE7R02ozn-ECsE3VBivNPx1cztD73D-pyP6wk-tJaKD7XD6Nqj6jAn5UOtpc_G7yMIRJ2RKvyjE3EAkDGpjZ4buy417s3FWZOJYdokDmmW3vM996GwB-IQTXKwkiIgm2tsPTCtoxp1NPzOjbPuJAnIZVA3QXmCxrkx6k-ihwEIQGBFjjD"},"htmlCode":{"name":"projects/10118471738337248464/files/0a6eaf79c2bc4274b20c25b020b51203","downloadUrl":"https://contribution.usercontent.google.com/download?c=CgthaWRhX2NvZGVmeBJ8Eh1hcHBfY29tcGFuaW9uX2dlbmVyYXRlZF9maWxlcxpbCiVodG1sXzk1ZjZkZGY4NTFkYTQ4OThiOWQxODlmNzQxMjFlODA4EgsSBxDFo92hywcYAZIBJAoKcHJvamVjdF9pZBIWQhQxMDExODQ3MTczODMzNzI0ODQ2NA&filename=&opi=96797242","mimeType":"text/html"},"id":"3849753b0c494e30a18f050daa64ac87","generatedBy":"figaro_agent","width":"2560","height":"2048","title":"Clean Structured Assignments Table","prompt":"Title: Clean Structured Assignments Table\nContext: A university application's student portal focused on a minimalist, highly readable assignments list.\nDescription of the screen: An elegant, structured table-view for university assignments inspired by high-end productivity apps.
