# Assignments Page Redesign v3

The assignments page has been completely redesigned from a simple list view into a highly interactive, 4-column **Kanban Board** to give you better spatial awareness of your workflow and tasks.

## Changes Made

### 1. Interactive Kanban Workflow
- Added a 4-column board: **Not Started**, **In Progress**, **Submitted**, and **Graded**.
- Assignments appear in their respective columns based on their current status.
- Implemented **1-click directional arrows** on every card (visible on hover) to instantly move assignments left or right between columns without opening the detail view!

### 2. Glassmorphic UI & Density
- Completely overhauled the UI with translucent, glassmorphic cards and floating columns.
- Removed the sidebar. The entire width of the screen is now dedicated to your assignment workflow.

### 3. Smart Filtering
- Added horizontally scrolling **Module Chips** at the top. Click them to instantly filter the entire board by module.
- Added quick toggles to **Hide non-submittable** and **Show submitted** assignments to keep your board clean.
- Added an **Advanced Filters** panel allowing you to filter by:
  - Due within 7 days, 14 days, 30 days, or anytime.
  - Minimum possible points.

### 4. Urgency Indicators
- Overdue assignments pulsate with a red glow.
- Assignments due within 3 days feature an amber/orange warning glow, drawing your eye immediately to what matters most.

## Verification

Please open [http://localhost:3000/assignments](http://localhost:3000/assignments) in your browser:
