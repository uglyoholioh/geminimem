# Refactor Assignments Page & Density

This plan aims to address the issue of the assignments list looking like "one long list" by introducing search, status filtering, grouped categorization, and a denser layout.

## Proposed Changes

### Frontend
#### [MODIFY] [page.tsx](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/app/assignments/page.tsx)
- **State Additions**:
  - `searchQuery` (`string`): To filter assignments by title or course code.
  - `statusFilter` (`string`): To filter assignments by their `user_status` (e.g., 'all', 'not_started', 'in_progress', 'submitted', 'graded').
- **Layout & Density Improvements**:
  - Update [renderList](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/app/assignments/page.tsx#173-210) to use tighter padding (`px-3 py-2`), smaller gaps, and horizontal alignment for metadata to reduce vertical height per item.
  - Change the "All" and "Upcoming" views to group assignments by urgency (e.g., "Overdue", "Due Next 7 Days", "Due Later", "No Due Date") instead of showing a flat list. This makes it instantly readable instead of overwhelming.
- **Header Updates**:
  - Add a sticky or top-level row to housing an elegant search input (`<input />` with a `Search` icon) and a status filter dropdown.
  - Make sure the refined components adhere to the existing sleek design language (muted text, accent colors, rounded borders).

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
1. I will implement the changes and the frontend dev server will hot-reload.
2. The user will be asked to navigate to [/assignments](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/app/assignments) on their local instance (`localhost:3000/assignments`).
3. User to verify:
   - Does the search bar correctly filter assignments by title and module code?
   - Does the status dropdown correctly filter?
   - Is the new layout denser and easier to scan?
   - Are the list items properly grouped by date urgency in the default views?
