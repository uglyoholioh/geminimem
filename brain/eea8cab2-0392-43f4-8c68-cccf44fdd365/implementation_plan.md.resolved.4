# Bento Box Dashboard Implementation

Based on an evaluation of the user experience and the overall premium aesthetic of the application, we are proceeding with the **Bento Box Dashboard** paradigm for the assignments page.

## Proposed Changes

### Frontend
#### [MODIFY] [page.tsx](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/app/assignments/page.tsx)
- **Layout & Structure**:
  - Remove the Kanban columns layout.
  - Implement a CSS Grid / Masonry-style "Bento Box" layout.
  - Separate assignments into intuitive sections: "Needs Attention" (Overdue, Due Soon, Not Started) and "Completed/Graded".
- **Dynamic Tile Sizing**:
  - High priority tasks (Overdue or Due within 3 days, high points) will span multiple columns or rows to draw immediate attention.
  - Lower priority or completed tasks will be smaller, standard 1x1 or 1x2 tiles.
- **Aesthetics**:
  - Use smooth, rounded corners (`rounded-3xl` or `rounded-2xl`).
  - Subtle gradients and colored glows for urgent items.
  - Glassmorphic translucent backgrounds (`bg-surface/50 backdrop-blur-md`).
- **Interactive State**:
  - Clicking a tile still opens the detail panel.
  - Retain the top header with module chips and advanced filters, as they still apply to filtering the bento board.

## Verification Plan
1. Implement the Bento grid in [page.tsx](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/app/notes/page.tsx).
2. Verify that urgent assignments are sized distinctly from completed ones.
3. Ensure the grid is responsive across screen sizes.
