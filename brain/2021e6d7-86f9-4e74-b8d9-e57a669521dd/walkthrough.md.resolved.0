# Announcements Feature Enhancement

I've successfully updated the announcements functionality across the dashboard, courses page, and a new dedicated announcements view.

### Changes Made
1. **Dashboard Updates**: Announcements now have a quick-view modal. When you click on an announcement from the dashboard widget, a modal pops up displaying the full HTML message content and optionally marking that announcement as "read". We retained the hover `X` icon to instantly dismiss notifications without reading.
2. **Dedicated Announcements Hub**: We built a brand new global URL `/announcements` which groups all recent announcements by class, has a toggle feature for switching between "unread" or "all", and a dedicated "Mark all read" quick-clean button.
3. **Course Page Auto-read**: The announcements tab within the individual course view was altered. Currently clicking to reveal the nested payload marks it as read immediately and asynchronously on the backend. This means the individual "Mark Read" button has been completely removed to create a frictionless experience.

### Video Demonstration
The entire lifecycle of clicking modals, moving between views, and automatically reading announcements can be seen below:
