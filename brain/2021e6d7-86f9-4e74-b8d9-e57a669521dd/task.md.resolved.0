# Announcements Feature: Mark as Read & Detail View

[ ] Update dashboard [app/page.tsx](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/app/page.tsx)
  - [ ] Allow clicking into an announcement to view details (perhaps via a modal/dialog).
  - [ ] Ensure "mark as read" works from the dashboard.
[ ] Enhance [app/history/page.tsx](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/app/history/page.tsx) or create a dedicated announcements view if it doesn't exist (wait, we have announcements in `courses/[id]/page.tsx` and on the dashboard. It was requested: "click into the announcements tab... and when i click on the announcement itll show me the announcement").
  - Wait, let me check if there's an `app/announcements` route. I'll need to define it or create it if missing, or update `app/courses/[id]/page.tsx` and [app/page.tsx](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/app/page.tsx).
