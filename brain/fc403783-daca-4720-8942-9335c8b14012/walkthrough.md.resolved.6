# Dashboard & Module Hub Redesign Walkthrough

I have completely redesigned the dashboard layout to solve the visual imbalance and give your **Module Hub** the space it deserves.

## 1. Balanced Mission Control
The top of your dashboard now features a more balanced side-by-side layout:
- **Command Center**: Occupies slightly more width (1.3:1 ratio) to ensure the chat and daily brief are clear and readable.
- **Today's Agenda**: Sits neatly alongside it, providing a compact timeline of your scheduled classes and tasks.

## 2. Full-Width Module Hub
The "Academic Track" is now the **Module Hub**, moved to its own dedicated row at the bottom.
- **Grid Layout**: Modules are now displayed in a responsive grid that spans the full width of your screen, making better use of the available space.
- **Enriched Cards**: 
    - You can now see the **top 2 most urgent tasks or deadlines** directly on each module card.
    - Quick-access icons for **Tasks**, **Assignments**, and **News** (Announcements) are still available for one-tap navigation.
- **Status Indicators**: Unread announcements are highlighted with a notification pulse.

## Verification Results
- [x] **Visual Balance**: Confirmed the dashboard is no longer "right-heavy".
- [x] **Accessibility**: Verified that the Module Hub is easier to scan and interact with.
- [x] **Data Integrity**: confirmed that module-specific tasks and assignments are correctly displayed on the cards.
- [x] **Code Health**: Fixed all syntax and lint issues introduced during the restructuring.

Your dashboard now feels much more organized and purposeful!
