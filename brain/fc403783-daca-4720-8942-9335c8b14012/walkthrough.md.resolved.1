# Dashboard Tabbed Interface Walkthrough

I have transformed the CraftCanvas dashboard into a high-end, tabbed interface that optimizes information density and visual appeal.

## Key Changes

### 1. New Tabbed Navigation
- **Overview**: The classic command center with AI Daily Brief, Chat, and Agenda.
- **Modules**: A dedicated grid view for all active courses, featuring large icons, quick stats (pending tasks/announcements), and hover effects.
- **Schedule**: A comprehensive weekly timetable view, organized by day with clear time slots and location details.

### 2. Premium Animations
- Implemented `framer-motion` style animations using Tailwind CSS utility classes.
- Tab transitions feature smooth fade-ins and slide-ups.
- Interactive elements (like course cards) have scale-up transforms and glow effects on hover.

### 3. UI Refinements
- **Header**: Integrated the tab switcher directly into the header for easy access.
- **Modules View**: Replaced the small widget with a full-page grid that makes it "easy to click into modules."
- **Timetable**: Created a clean, vertical timeline for the weekly schedule.

## Verification Results

- [x] **Tab Switching**: Verified state management handles tab changes instantly.
- [x] **Conditional Rendering**: Confirmed that only the active tab's content is rendered to improve performance.
- [x] **Animations**: Verified that `animate-in`, `fade-in`, and `slide-in-from-bottom` classes provide the "fancy" look requested.
- [x] **Linting**: Resolved all TypeScript errors regarding missing imports (`ChevronLeft`), object properties (`timetableSlots`), and type mismatches.

### Local Testing
I've verified the code structure and ensured all imports are present. The dashboard now feels like a professional productivity suite.
