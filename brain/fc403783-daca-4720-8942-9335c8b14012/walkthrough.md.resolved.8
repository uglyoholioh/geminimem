# Module Hub & Layout Refinement Walkthrough

I have completed the refinements to the Module Hub and the dashboard layout to ensure you have full control over what you see and to eliminate empty space.

## 1. Module Visibility Management
You can now easily choose which modules are displayed on your dashboard.
- **Toggle Visibility**: I've added a **'VISIBILITY'** button to the Module Hub header. 
- **Live Updates**: Clicking it reveals a list of all your modules with "Eye" icons. Toggle them on or off, and the dashboard updates immediately after you click **'DONE'**.
- **Clean Focus**: Modules you hide are completely removed from the Module Hub cards, keeping your view focused on your current active workload.

## 2. Optimized Vertical Space
The dashboard now fills your screen more effectively.
- **Increased Height**: I've stretched the main dashboard columns to **700px**, filling the previous empty space at the bottom.
- **Perfect Symmetry**: The **Command Center** and the **Sidebar Stack** (Agenda + Module Hub) stay perfectly aligned in height for a premium, balanced feel.

## Verification Highlights
- [x] **Filtering**: Confirmed that hidden modules are excluded from the main hub view.
- [x] **Toggle Logic**: Verified that the visibility state persists via the backend API.
- [x] **Visual Polish**: Confirmed that the increased height provides a more immersive "Mission Control" experience without unused gaps.

Enjoy your cleaner, more personalized dashboard!
