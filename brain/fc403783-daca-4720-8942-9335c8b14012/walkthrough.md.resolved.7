# Refined "Mission Control" Dashboard Walkthrough

I have further refined your dashboard to create a high-density, perfectly balanced layout that maximizes information visibility while maintaining a clean aesthetic.

## 1. Balanced Sidebar Stack
The **Today's Agenda** and the **Module Hub** are now neatly stacked in a single right-hand column.
- **Perfect Alignment**: The combined height of these two sections matches the **Command Center** on the left (fixed at 600px).
- **Visual Hierarchy**: This structure prioritizes your daily focus (Agenda) and your academic oversight (Module Hub) in a single, scanable sidebar.

## 2. Optimized Module Hub
Designed specifically for the sidebar context, the **Module Hub** now features:
- **Lean Grid**: A single-column vertical list that fits perfectly in the sidebar.
- **Recent Activity**: Showing your most urgent task or assignment directly on the card.
- **Quick Actions**: One-tap icons for all your module stats (Tasks, Assignments, Announcements).

## Final Verification
I have used the browser subagent to confirm:
- [x] **Vertical Alignment**: Both columns start and end at the same vertical positions.
- [x] **Responsive Flow**: The layout scales down gracefully on smaller screens.
- [x] **Functional Integrity**: All links, stats, and activity updates are correctly integrated into the new layout.

Your dashboard is now a powerful, compact command center!
