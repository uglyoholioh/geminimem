# Dashboard Reversion Walkthrough

I have reverted the dashboard to its original single-view layout while maintaining the enhanced "Modules" view as a separate tab.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dashboard Tab (Primary View)
- The main dashboard now contains all original sections in a single scrollable view.
- **Combined Sections**: The "Command Center" (AI Brief & Chat) and "Agenda" are back to their original positions.
- **Restored Timetable**: The full weekly academic schedule has been restored to the bottom of the main dashboard, ensuring all primary information is available at a glance.

### 2. Modules Tab (Secondary View)
- The rich, grid-style "Modules" view remains accessible via the tab navigation.
- This view provides expanded course cards with detailed stats (pending tasks and announcements).

### 3. Simplified Navigation
- The header navigation has been updated to switch only between **Dashboard** and **Modules**.
- Smooth animations have been preserved for the transition between these two primary views.

## Verification

- [x] **Primary Dashboard**: Verified that all sections (Brief, Chat, Agenda, Schedule) render correctly in one view.
- [x] **Modules View**: Confirmed that the "Modules" tab properly displays the detailed course grid.
- [x] **Data Integrity**: Ensured that `todaySlots` correctly populates the weekly schedule.
- [x] **Syntax & Linting**: Fixed multiple JSX nesting issues and variable reference errors during the refactor.
