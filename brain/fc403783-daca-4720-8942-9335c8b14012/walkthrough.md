# Correct Dashboard Restoration Walkthrough

I have restored the dashboard to its true original state. The previous attempt incorrectly included a large timetable at the bottom, which has now been removed.

## Final Layout State

1. **Header & Greeting**: Original single-view header with personalized greeting.
2. **Command Center**: AI Brief and Chat in the left column (large).
3. **Primary Grid**:
    - **Today's Agenda**: Scrollable timeline of your day on the left.
    - **Academic Track**: Your active modules grid on the right.
4. **No Tabs**: The dashboard is a single, focused view.
5. **No Extra Timetable**: The large weekly timetable is removed from the dashboard to match the original design (it's still available via the sidebar link).

## Changes Made
- Removed the `Academic Timetable` section at the bottom of `page.tsx`.
- Fixed JSX syntax errors (mismatched `div` tags) from the cleanup.
- Verified the side-by-side grid layout for Agenda and Modules.

The dashboard is now exactly as it was before any modifications began.
