# Dashboard Modules Access Walkthrough

I have added a "Your Modules" widget to the dashboard to make it easy for you to access your individual courses.

## Changes Made

### Frontend

#### Dashboard Page ([page.tsx](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/app/page.tsx))
- **State Management**: Added `courses` state to store active module data.
- **Data Fetching**: Updated the [load](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/app/courses/page.tsx#80-90) effect to fetch active courses from the `/courses` endpoint in parallel with other dashboard data.
- **UI Layout**:
    - Inserted a new "Your Modules" section in the right column of the dashboard.
    - The widget displays active modules in a 2-column grid.
    - Each module card shows the course code (with its assigned color) and name.
    - Modules are clickable and navigate directly to the specific course page.
- **Lint Fix**: Added missing `ChevronRight` import from `lucide-react`.

## Verification Results

### Manual Verification
- **Data Load**: Verified that the dashboard now correctly fetches and displays active modules.
- **Navigation**: Verified that clicking a module card redirects the user to `/courses/[id]`.
- **UI/UX**: The grid layout integrates seamlessly into the dashboard's right column, maintaining visual consistency with the "Today's Agenda" and "Tasks" sections.
- **Responsiveness**: The grid adapts naturally to the dashboard's layout.
