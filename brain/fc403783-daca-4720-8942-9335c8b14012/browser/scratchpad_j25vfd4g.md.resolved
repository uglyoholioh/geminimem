# Task: Visual Verification of Dashboard Layout

## Plan
1. Open http://localhost:3000 (or http://localhost:3001). [DONE]
2. Capture screenshot of the dashboard. [DONE]
3. Analyze 'Command Center', 'Today's Agenda', and 'Module Hub' layout. [DONE]
4. Check for alignment, vertical stretching, and column balance. [DONE]
5. Report findings to the user. [DONE]

## Findings
- **Layout Structure**: The dashboard uses a two-column grid layout.
- **Top Row**: 'Command Center' occupies the left column, while 'Today's Agenda' occupies the right column.
- **Module Hub**: Located in the right column, directly below 'Today's Agenda'.
- **Unbalanced Columns**: The left column remains empty below the 'Command Center', while the right column contains both the agenda and the module hub. This creates a significant "right-heavy" imbalance as the user scrolls.
- **Constraint**: 'Module Hub' is restricted to the width of the right column (~50% of the screen), which contradicts the user's request that it "can take up more space".
- **Functionality**: Each module in the hub correctly displays quick access links for Tasks, To-Do, and News (Announcements), along with counts/stats.
- **Visual Stretching**: The right column extends significantly further than the left column, leading to poor vertical balance.
