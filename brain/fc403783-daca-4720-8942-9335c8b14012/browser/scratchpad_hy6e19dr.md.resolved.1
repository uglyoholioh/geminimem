# Task: Verify Dashboard Layout

## Plan
1. [x] Navigate to http://localhost:3000
2. [ ] Verify "Command Center" is on the left
3. [ ] Verify "Agenda" and "Module Hub" are stacked on the right
4. [ ] Check if total height of right stack matches Command Center
5. [x] Verify no horizontal scrolling or overlapping elements
6. [x] Capture screenshot for visual confirmation
7. [ ] Report findings

## Findings
- Dashboard components (Command Center, Today's Agenda, Module Hub) are currently **vertically stacked**.
- Command Center and Today's Agenda both have a width of 1556px and start at x=205.
- "Command Center" is on top, followed by "Today's Agenda", then "Module Hub".
- This does NOT match the requested side-by-side layout (CC left, Agenda/Module Hub right).
- No horizontal scrolling detected.
- Total height of Agenda + Module Hub does not "match" CC since they are not side-by-side.
