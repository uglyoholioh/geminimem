# Task: Visual Verification of Dashboard Layout

## Plan
1. Open http://localhost:3000 (or http://localhost:3001). [DONE]
2. Capture screenshot of the dashboard. [DONE]
3. Analyze 'Command Center', 'Today's Agenda', and 'Module Hub' layout. [DONE]
4. Check for alignment, vertical stretching, and column balance. [DONE]
5. Report findings to the user. [IN PROGRESS]

## Findings
- **Alignment**: 'Command Center' and 'Today's Agenda' are aligned at the top in a two-column layout.
- **Column Balance**: 'Module Hub' is positioned in the right column below 'Today's Agenda'. The left column (below 'Command Center') appears empty, leading to a "right-heavy" layout as the user scrolls.
- **Stretching**: 'Module Hub' is relatively narrow and has its own internal scrollbar. It doesn't take advantage of the full width available, even though the user mentioned it can take up more space.
- **Visual Issues**: The empty space on the left when scrolling down looks like a bug or poor design choice.
