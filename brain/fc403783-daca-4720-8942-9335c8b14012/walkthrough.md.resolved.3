# Dashboard Reversion Walkthrough

I have completely reverted the dashboard to its original state as requested. The tabbed interface and the isolated Modules view have been removed.

## Changes Made

### 1. Full Dashboard Restoration
- **Single View**: The dashboard is back to its original layout where all primary information is available on one page.
- **Header**: Restored the original greeting and status badges without the tab navigation.
- **Command Center**: The AI Brief and Chat sections are restored to their original positions.
- **Agenda & Modules**: The "Today's Agenda" and "Academic Track" grid are side-by-side in the main view.
- **Timetable**: The full weekly timetable is restored to the bottom of the page.

### 2. Cleanup
- Removed the `activeTab` state and all related navigation logic.
- Fixed a minor typo in the timetable rendering (`mt-1.5`).
- Ensured all data (courses, slots, tasks) is correctly referenced in the unified view.

## Verification
- [x] Verified that the dashboard renders correctly as a single, scrollable page.
- [x] Confirmed that all AI features and timetable functionality are intact.
- [x] Checked for any remaining tab-related code and removed it.
