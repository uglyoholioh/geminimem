# Tabbed Dashboard Implementation Plan

The goal is to enhance the dashboard by introducing a tabbed interface. This will allow for more focused views, specifically a rich "Modules" view and a dedicated "Schedule" view, while keeping the "Overview" as the primary landing spot. We will also implement smooth animations for tab switching.

## Proposed Changes

### Dashboard Page ([frontend/app/page.tsx](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/app/page.tsx))

#### [MODIFY] [page.tsx](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/app/page.tsx)
- **Tab State**: Introduce `activeTab` state ('overview' | 'modules' | 'schedule').
- **Tab Navigation**: Add a sleek tab switcher in the header with micro-animations.
- **Overview Tab**: Current dashboard content (Today's Agenda, Tasks, Assignments).
- **Modules Tab**:
  - Expanded grid or list of active modules.
  - Per-module quick stats (assignment progress, unread announcements).
  - Quick action buttons for each module (View Tasks, View Brief).
- **Schedule Tab**: Dedicated full-width view of the week's classes and upcoming deadlines.
- **Animations**: Use CSS transitions and `animate-in` classes for smooth tab switching.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
- Verify tab switching works correctly.
- Verify animations are smooth and "cool".
- Verify "Modules" tab shows comprehensive data.
- Verify "Schedule" tab displays the weekly outlook accurately.
