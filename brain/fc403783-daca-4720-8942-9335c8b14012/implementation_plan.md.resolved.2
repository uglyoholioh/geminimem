# Dashboard Reversion and Modules Tab Implementation Plan

The user wants to revert the main dashboard to its original single-view layout (removing the global tab switching for Overview and Schedule) but keep the new, enhanced "Modules" view as a separate tab or section.

## Proposed Changes

### Dashboard Page ([frontend/app/page.tsx](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/app/page.tsx))

#### [MODIFY] [page.tsx](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/app/page.tsx)
- **Simplify Structure**: Remove the `activeTab === 'overview'` and `activeTab === 'schedule'` conditional wrappers.
- **Restore Single View**: The "Overview" content (Command Center, Agenda, Academic Track summary) and the "Schedule" view (if it was originally there or if the user wants it back) will be merged back into a single primary view.
  - *Correction based on user instruction*: "Only the modules section of that added to another tab". I will restore the original dashboard layout as the primary view.
- **Modules Tab**:
  - Keep the `activeTab` state but use it *only* to switch between the main Dashboard and the enhanced Modules view.
  - Alternatively, if the user wants the "original dashboard" exactly as it was, and the "modules section" as a tab:
    - I will keep a simple tab switcher: **Dashboard** | **Modules**.
    - "Dashboard" will contain everything the old dashboard had.
    - "Modules" will contain the new grid view.
- **Header UI**: Simplified tab switcher (e.g., "Dashboard" and "Courses" or "Modules").

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
- Verify the main dashboard looks exactly as it did before (single scrollable view or original grid).
- Verify clicking the "Modules" tab shows the new enhanced view.
- Verify animations still look good for this specific transition.
