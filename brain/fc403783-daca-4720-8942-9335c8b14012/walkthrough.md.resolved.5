# Module Hub Redesign Walkthrough

I have transformed the "Academic Track" into a much more powerful **Module Hub**. This new section provides a comprehensive overview and quick access to all your important module data directly from the dashboard.

## Key Features

1. **Active Modules Only**: The Hub now cleanly filters to show only the modules you've selected as active.
2. **Rich Module Cards**:
    - **Quick Stats**: Each card now displays real-time counts for Assignments, To-Do Tasks, and Unread Announcements.
    - **One-Tap Access**: Icons for Tasks, Assignments, and Announcements take you directly to the relevant filtered views.
    - **Status Pulse**: An animated notification dot appears if there are unread announcements.
    - **Color-Coded**: Modules maintain their specific color coding for quick visual identification.
3. **Deep Navigation**: Easily jump into the full module detail page using the expand icon on each card.
4. **Optimized Layout**: The Module Hub has been given more vertical space to handle more content while remaining clean and focused.
