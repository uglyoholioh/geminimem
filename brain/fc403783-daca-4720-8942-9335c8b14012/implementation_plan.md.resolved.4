# Module Hub Redesign Implementation Plan

Redesign the "Academic Track" section into a richer "Module Hub". This section will show only active modules and provide quick access to assignments, tasks, announcements, and module briefs with summary stats or top items.

## Proposed Changes

### Dashboard Page ([page.tsx](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/app/page.tsx))

#### [MODIFY] [page.tsx](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/app/page.tsx)
- **Rename Section**: Change "Academic Track" heading to "Module Hub".
- **Enhanced Module Cards**:
    - Update the module card layout to a more detailed view.
    - Add quick-access icons/links for:
        - **Assignments**: Show count and link to filtered view.
        - **Tasks**: Show count and link to filtered view.
        - **Announcements**: Show unread count and trigger modal or link.
        - **Module Brief**: Link to a specific module brief view (if available) or relevant section.
    - Use a more spacious layout to accommodate these additions.
- **Layout Adjustment**: 
    - Adjust the right column grid or overflow behavior to allow "Module Hub" to take up more presence if needed.
    - Consider wrapping the hub in a more premium container with hover effects.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
- Verify that only "active" modules (those selected during onboarding/saved as active) are displayed.
- Verify that the section is renamed to "Module Hub".
- Check that each module card displays correct stats for assignments and announcements.
- Confirm that clicking quick-access icons navigates to the correct filtered views or opens relevant modals.
- Ensure the design feels premium and matches the "Module Hub" aesthetic.
