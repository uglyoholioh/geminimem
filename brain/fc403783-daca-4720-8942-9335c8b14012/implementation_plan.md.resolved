# Dashboard Layout Refinement Plan

The goal is to optimize the dashboard space by stacking "Today's Agenda" and "Module Hub" in a right-hand column, balancing them against the "Command Center" on the left.

## Proposed Changes

### Dashboard Page ([page.tsx](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/app/page.tsx))

#### [MODIFY] [page.tsx](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/app/page.tsx)
- **Restructure Grid**:
    - Revert the "Command Center" and sidebar to a 2-column grid (`lg:grid-cols-[1.3fr,1fr]`).
    - The left column remains the **Command Center** (fixed or min height of around 600px).
    - The right column will now be a `flex flex-col` container matching the height of the Command Center.
- **Stack Sections**:
    - **Today's Agenda**: Place in the top half of the right column. Use a smaller min-height or flexible height.
    - **Module Hub**: Place directly under the Agenda in the right column.
    - **Proportional Heights**: Ensure the combined height of Agenda and Module Hub equals the Command Center height.
- **Compact Module Hub**:
    - Since the Module Hub is back in a column, switch its internal grid to `grid-cols-1` or a compact `grid-cols-2` if width allows, but prioritize a vertical list or small grid that fits the sidebar.
    - Keep the rich card details but ensure they scale down gracefully for the narrower column.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
- Verify that the Command Center, Agenda, and Module Hub are all visible without excessive scrolling.
- Confirm that the Agenda and Module Hub are stacked correctly in the right column.
- Check that the vertical heights align as requested.
- Ensure the layout is responsive on smaller screens.
