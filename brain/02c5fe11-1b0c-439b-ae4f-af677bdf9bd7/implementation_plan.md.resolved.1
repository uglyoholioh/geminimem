# Fix 404 Error: Missing Timetable Day Endpoint

The frontend dashboard attempts to fetch timetable slots for future days if today is empty, using the endpoint `/api/v1/timetable/day/{date}`. However, this endpoint is not currently implemented in the backend.

## Proposed Changes

### [Component Name] backend/routers/timetable.py

Implement the `@router.get("/day/{day_str}")` endpoint.
- It will accept a date string in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
- It will filter `TimetableSlot` by user and `day_of_week`.
- It will use the existing [slot_occurs_on_date](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/backend/routers/timetable.py#26-116) helper to handle `RRULE` and `EXDATE` logic.
- It will return a structure similar to the `/today` endpoint for consistency.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- I will use `curl` or a Python script to verify the new endpoint returns 200 OK and expected data for a valid date.

### Manual Verification
- Reload the dashboard and verify that the "Lookahead" logic now correctly fetches and displays slots for future days instead of throwing a 404 error.
