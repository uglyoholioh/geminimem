# Focus Tab Implemented

The Focus tab is now implemented with a fully-featured Pomodoro timer, integrated with your existing Tasks!

## Changes Made

### 1. New Backend `actual_minutes` Tracking
The [Task](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/app/page.tsx#44-52) model in the backend was updated to include an `actual_minutes` column. When the Pomodoro timer runs, every accrued minute is pushed back to the backend to keep a true record of how much time you've spent on each task.

### 2. New Sidebar Navigation
A new [Focus](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/app/focus/page.tsx#23-295) clock icon has been added to the main navigation sidebar, right after `Notes`.

### 3. Focus Page ([app/focus/page.tsx](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/app/focus/page.tsx))
A brand new, aesthetically pleasing dashboard dedicated to deep work:
- **Timer Modes**: Quickly swap between "Focus" (25m), "Short Break" (5m), and "Long Break" (15m).
- **Responsive Timer UI**: A large, centered timer that looks great at standard scales, with fluid background blurring depending on the mode you are in.
- **Task Selector**: Automatically reads your "Inbox" and "In Progress" tasks. Picking a task links the timer session to it.
- **Auto-Syncing**: As you play the timer, after every accumulated 60 seconds of Focus, it sends a transparent background update to the API to keep your task's `actual_minutes` synced.

## Verification Performed

I ran an automated browser sub-agent to navigate to the new [Focus](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/app/focus/page.tsx#23-295) tab. 

**Sub-agent observations:**
- The Timer counts down correctly.
- The UI handles the `Play` / `Pause` / `Reset` functionality.
- Task selection updates the central dashboard area.
- (A small backend routing issue caused a temporary 500 error, but that was caught and fixed after the recording).
