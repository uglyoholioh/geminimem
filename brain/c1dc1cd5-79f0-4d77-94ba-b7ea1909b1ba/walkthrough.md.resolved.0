# Dashboard & Task Progress Feature Walkthrough

The task functionality has been significantly updated with a highly requested "Percentage completion" feature!

## 1. Backend Updates
- The [tasks](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/backend/routers/tasks.py#59-120) SQL database table has been migrated to include a new `percentage_done` INTEGER field.
- The Python SQLModel definition ([backend/models/task.py](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/backend/models/task.py)) was updated to include: `percentage_done: int = Field(default=0)`.
- Replaced backend API schemas in ([backend/routers/tasks.py](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/backend/routers/tasks.py)) to validate and return `percentage_done`. Creating, fetching, modifying, and completing tasks correctly maps this new field.

## 2. Frontend Board (Kanban) View
- The internal task interface has been updated to expect `percentage_done`.
- Small pill badges have been added to task cards in the "In Progress" group within the Kanban Board view ([frontend/components/tasks/KanbanBoard.tsx](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/components/tasks/KanbanBoard.tsx)).
- These display the completed percentage (e.g., `55%`) clearly to visually indicate progress without clutter.

## 3. Frontend Dashboard Updates
- The Dashboard UI now fetches tasks as normal but re-orders them to dramatically improve prioritization:
  1. `in_progress` tasks are pulled straight to the top.
  2. The remaining fall back to "closest deadlines" and "highest priority".
- A sleek, minimalist slider has been added beneath `in_progress` tasks in the Dashboard. 
  - Dragging the slider automatically issues debounced/`onMouseUp` `PUT` requests back to the server to instantly persist changes. 
  - The appearance utilises a dynamic `linear-gradient` to visually highlight completion cleanly without excessive glow or distracting elements!
  
You can view these changes by visiting the dashboard or looking at your tasks within the board view!
