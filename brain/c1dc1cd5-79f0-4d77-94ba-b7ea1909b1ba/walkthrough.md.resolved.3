# Dashboard & Task Progress Feature Walkthrough

The task functionality has been significantly updated with a highly requested "Percentage completion" feature!

## 1. Backend Updates
- The [tasks](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/backend/routers/tasks.py#59-120) SQL database table has been migrated to include a new `percentage_done` INTEGER field.
- The Python SQLModel definition ([backend/models/task.py](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/backend/models/task.py)) was updated to include: `percentage_done: int = Field(default=0)`.
- Replaced backend API schemas in ([backend/routers/tasks.py](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/backend/routers/tasks.py)) to validate and return `percentage_done`. Creating, fetching, modifying, and completing tasks correctly maps this new field.

## 2. Frontend Board (Kanban) View
- Made the **Kanban Board** the default view for the tasks page!
- A brand new "**Group By**" toggle has been added to the top of the board. You can now seamlessly switch between organizing your Kanban board by:
  - **Status** (`Inbox`, `In Progress`, `Completed`)
  - **Priority** (`Urgent`, `High`, `Medium`, `Low`)
  - **Module** (Automatically generates columns for your `course_codes`!)
- Dragging and dropping tasks between columns automatically maps back to the database depending on the grouping context (e.g. moving a task to the `Urgent` column will instantly update its priority via API!)
- Small pill badges remain on task cards in the "In Progress" group within the Kanban Board view, displaying their percentage smoothly.

## 3. Frontend Dashboard Updates
- The Dashboard UI now drastically improves displaying critical info:
  1. `in_progress` tasks AND `Critical` tasks (High/Urgent priority + due within 3 days) are pulled securely to the absolute top of your queue.
  2. The remaining tasks fall back to a "closest deadlines" calculation.
- We have expanded the maximum number of tasks visible on the dashboard from 4 up to 6 to show more contextual information at a glance.
- The slider beneath `in_progress` tasks has been completely revamped into a **super-compact segmented level bar**.
  - It features 10 discrete, clickable levels (10% each) housed in a button-like minimalist pill.
  - This design provides a premium, "dashboard-ready" aesthetic that avoids generic glow or bulky sliders.
- **Enhanced Criticality Sorting**: The Dashboard now intelligently prioritizes **Critical Tasks** (Urgent/High priority + Due within 3 days) at the very top, even above regular in_progress tasks, ensuring you never miss a high-stakes deadline.
- **Dashboard Cleanup**: Removed the redundant duplicate task section, leaving only the primary section with the new compact segmented progress widget.

You can verify these enhancements by exploring the grouping in the tasks page or clicking the new level-segments right from your Dashboard!
