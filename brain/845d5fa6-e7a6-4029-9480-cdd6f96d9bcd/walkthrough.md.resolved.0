# Dashboard Redesign

The dashboard has been successfully redesigned to provide critical information at a glance with intentional use of space and no unnecessary scrolling.

## Changes Made

- **Layout Structure**: Migrated from a 60/40 two-column split with scrolling cards to a **fixed-height viewport layout** using flex proportions.
- **Section Sizing**:
  - The left column is split **70/30** between the Daily Brief & Chat and Upcoming Assignments.
  - The right column is split **40/30/30** among Today's Schedule, Tasks, and Announcements.
- **Content Cutoffs**: Long-list sections are now capped to prevent them from growing unbounded:
  - Schedule: max 4 classes
  - Tasks: max 4 open tasks
  - Announcements: max 3 recent announcements
  - Assignments: max 4 upcoming assignments
  - If a section has more items, a "View all →" link indicates the remaining count.
- **Header Stats**: The redundant "This Week" stats card was removed. Key metrics (Open Tasks, Classes Today, Due Soon, Unread) are now shown as inline stat badges in the top right header.
- **Empty States**: Replaced large, padded empty state messages ("No classes today") with compact italic strings to reclaim wasted vertical space.

## Validation

- Verified in the browser at `http://localhost:3000/`.
- Confirmed there is **no page-level scrollbar**.
- Confirmed sections expand visually proportional to their flex ratio while holding their content constraints intact.
