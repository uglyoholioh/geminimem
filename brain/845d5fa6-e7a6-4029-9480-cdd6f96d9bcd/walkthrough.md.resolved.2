# Dashboard Redesign

The dashboard has been successfully redesigned to provide critical information at a glance with intentional use of space and no unnecessary scrolling.

## Changes Made

- **Layout Structure**: Migrated from a 60/40 two-column split with scrolling cards to a **fixed-height viewport layout** using flex proportions.
- **Section Sizing**:
  - The left column is split **70/30** between the Daily Brief & Chat and Upcoming Assignments.
  - The right column is split **40/30/30** among Today's Schedule, Tasks, and Announcements.
- **Content Cutoffs**: Long-list sections are now capped to prevent them from growing unbounded:
  - Schedule: max 4 classes
  - Tasks: max 4 open tasks
  - Announcements: max 3 recent announcements
  - Assignments: max 4 upcoming assignments
  - If a section has more items, a "View all →" link indicates the remaining count.
- **Header Stats**: The redundant "This Week" stats card was removed. Key metrics (Open Tasks, Classes Today, Due Soon, Unread) are now shown as inline stat badges in the top right header.
- **Empty States**: Replaced large, padded empty state messages ("No classes today") with compact italic strings to reclaim wasted vertical space.

## Validation

- Verified in the browser at `http://localhost:3000/`.
- Confirmed there is **no page-level scrollbar**.
- Confirmed sections expand visually proportional to their flex ratio while holding their content constraints intact.

## Polishing Task Management UI

### Dashboard Tasks
- **Single-Click Completion:** The priority dot has been replaced with an interactive checkbox outlined with the task's priority color. Users can now click the checkbox directly from the dashboard to mark a task as completed (or incomplete).
- **Quick Deletion:** Hovering over a task row in the dashboard now reveals a trash icon, allowing quick deletions without needing to navigate to the Tasks page.
- Changes are optimistically updated for instant UI feedback and synced via the backend.

### Tasks Page UI Fixes
- **Static Tags Input:** Removed the `w-24 focus:w-40 transition-all` that caused the 'tags...' input in the Quick Creator to expand and shift surrounding elements when clicked. It is now set to a permanent appropriate size (`w-32`) and merely focuses when clicked.
- **AM/PM Visibility:** Increased the width of the native HTML time picker in the Quick Creator from `w-20` to `w-28` to ensure the AM/PM selector is fully visible and not cut off on webkit browsers.
