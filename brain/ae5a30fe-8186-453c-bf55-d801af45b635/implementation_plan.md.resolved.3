# Fix GLM API 404 Error

The user is encountering a 404 error when saving/testing their GLM API key. Investigation shows that the `api.z.ai` endpoint requires a `/api/paas/v4` path segment which was missing in our current implementation.

## Proposed Changes

### Backend

#### [MODIFY] [ai_assistant.py](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/LMSManager/backend/app/services/ai_assistant.py)
- Update `base_urls` to use `https://api.z.ai/api/paas/v4/chat/completions`.
- Ensure standard Zhipu AI endpoint is also correct.

#### [MODIFY] [brief.py](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/LMSManager/backend/app/routes/brief.py)
- Update the direct `httpx` call to use `https://api.z.ai/api/paas/v4/chat/completions`.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- Run a debug script to ping the new endpoints.
- Trigger the `/ai-assistant/test-ai` endpoint via a script.

### Manual Verification
- Ask the user to try saving the API key again in the settings page.
