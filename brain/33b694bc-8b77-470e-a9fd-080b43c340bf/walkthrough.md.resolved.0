# Walkthrough - Implementing Quick Wins

I have completed the prioritized "quick wins" for CraftCanvas, focusing on code quality, user experience, and branding.

## Changes Made

### Frontend Type Consolidation
- Centralized core TypeScript types ([Task](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/app/tasks/page.tsx#47-67), [Assignment](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/lib/types.ts#48-69), [Announcement](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/lib/types.ts#70-83), [Course](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/app/courses/page.tsx#24-37), [TimetableSlot](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/lib/types.ts#84-100), [BriefData](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/lib/types.ts#101-111)) in [types.ts](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/lib/types.ts).
- Refactored the Dashboard, Tasks, and Assignments pages to use these shared types, ensuring consistency and better IDE support.

### UX Improvements
- **Dashboard Skeleton**: Replaced the "Loading..." text with a polished [DashboardSkeleton](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/app/page.tsx#33-49) component.
- **Task Sorting**: Integrated the [sortTasksByCriticality](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/lib/taskSort.ts#3-25) utility in the dashboard for consistent task prioritization.
- **Branding**:
  - Generated a professional logo and set it as the application's favicon.
  - Added unique page titles (e.g., "Dashboard | CraftCanvas", "Tasks | CraftCanvas") for better navigation.

### Backend & Infrastructure
- **Timezone Standardization**: Updated the backend models to use Singapore timezone (`Asia/Singapore`) for all `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps.
- **Test Stability**:
  - Configured Playwright with strict timeouts to prevent hanging processes.
  - Verified backend changes with automated tests (7 passed).

## Verification Results

### Automated Tests
- Backend models verified with `pytest`: **7 Passed**.
- Playwright configuration updated to prevent future CI hangs.

### Manual Verification
- Verified that the dashboard now loads with a skeleton state.
- Verified that the page title changes dynamically when navigating between views.
- Verified that the favicon is correctly displayed.
