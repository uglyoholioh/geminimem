# Walkthrough: User-selectable Colour Schemes

Users can now choose from several premium colour schemes in the application settings.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Colour Schemes in CSS
Added `Midnight`, `Forest`, and `Sunset` colour palettes to [globals.css](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/app/globals.css) using CSS variables scoped by `data-scheme` attributes.

### 2. Global Theme Management
- Created a [ThemeProvider](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/components/ThemeProvider.tsx#18-89) React context to manage both the appearance mode (Light/Dark/System) and the selected Colour Scheme.
- Integrated the provider into the root layout for global availability.
- Replaced the legacy theme-switching script with a more robust React-based solution that also handles external colour schemes.

### 3. Settings UI Improvements
- Enhanced the "Appearance" tab in the Settings page.
- Added a visual preview grid for selecting colour schemes.
- Hooked up selection to persist both to `localStorage` (for immediate load) and the backend (for cross-device sync).

## Verification Results

### Build & Compilation
- Verified frontend build with `npm run build`.
- No TypeScript or compilation errors found in the new theme logic.

### UI/UX Validation
- Schemes apply instantly upon selection.
- Persistence verified through `localStorage` and backend settings API integration.
- The "Default" scheme remains available to revert to the original Academic Life OS aesthetic.
