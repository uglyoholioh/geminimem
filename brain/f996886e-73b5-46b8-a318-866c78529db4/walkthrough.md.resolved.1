# Walkthrough - Settings Page Fixes & Adaptive Theming

I have resolved the display issues on the Settings page and enhanced the colour scheme feature to be fully adaptive and reactive.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Settings Page Layout
- **Fixed Tab Content**: Resolved a bug where the "Craft Workspace Sync" section was visible across all tabs. It is now correctly scoped to the **Craft** tab.
- **Improved UI Polish**: Cleaned up the spacing and alignment for a more premium feel.

### 2. Adaptive Colour Schemes
All colour schemes now have distinct **Light** and **Dark** mode variants. This means choosing "Midnight" will provide a clean bluish light theme or a deep slate dark theme, depending on your system/theme preference.

- **Midnight**: Adaptive slate and azure tones.
- **Forest**: Elegant emerald and sage greens.
- **Sunset**: Warm amber and burnt orange shades.

### 3. Immediate Persistence
- **Instant Visual Feedback**: Changing the colour scheme updates the UI immediately across the entire application.
- **Automatic Saving**: The selected colour scheme is now saved to the backend as soon as you click it, eliminating the need to manually click "Save Changes" for appearance settings.

## Verification Results

### Manual Test Steps
- [x] **Tab Navigation**: Verified that switching between Profile, Canvas, Craft, and Appearance shows only the relevant sections.
- [x] **Immediate Change**: Confirmed that clicking a colour scheme (e.g., Forest) instantly updates the dashboard and settings UI.
- [x] **Dark/Light Mode**: Verified that switching from Light to Dark mode while on the "Sunset" scheme correctly shifts the background and surface colours while maintaining the orange accents.
- [x] **Persistence**: Confirmed that settings are preserved after a page refresh.
