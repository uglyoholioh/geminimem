# Dashboard Module Hub Optimization

The goal is to optimize the Module Hub widget on the dashboard for better space utilization and user experience, implementing quick actions and a denser layout.

## User Review Required

> [!IMPORTANT]
> I am reverting the changes made to the standalone Courses page (`/courses`) as the user clarified they intended these changes for the Dashboard widget.

## Proposed Changes

### Reversion

#### [REVERT] [page.tsx](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/app/courses/page.tsx)
- Revert all layout and styling changes to restore the original 2-column grid and persistent footer actions.

---

### Dashboard Module Hub

#### [MODIFY] [ModuleHub.tsx](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/components/dashboard/ModuleHub.tsx)

**Space Utilization:**
- Change the vertical list to a **grid layout** (`grid-cols-2`) when not in visibility mode.
- Reduce vertical padding and margins on the module cards.
- Make the card footer (actions) appear on **hover** only to save vertical space.

**Quick Actions:**
- Add **Quick Add** icons for "New Task" and "New Note" in the card header (visible on hover).
- Ensure "Manage" link and "Visibility" toggle remain accessible but compact.

**Visual Polish:**
- Add subtle hover animations (lift/scale).
- Refine typography to ensure clarity in a denser grid.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- N/A (Visual/Interaction focus)

### Manual Verification
- Verify the Dashboard Module Hub now displays modules in a 2-column grid.
- Confirm quick actions (New Task, New Note) appear on hover and navigate correctly.
- Ensure the "Visibility" toggle still works and functions correctly with the new layout.
