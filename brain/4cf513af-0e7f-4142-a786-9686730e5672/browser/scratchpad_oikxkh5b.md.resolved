# Task: Verify Module Hub Changes

## Plan
- [X] Navigate to the dashboard (root URL) - FAILED (Browser CDP error)
- [ ] Verify Module Hub widget uses a 2-column grid
- [ ] Test module card hover (quick action bar)
- [ ] Test 'VISIBILITY' toggle list
- [ ] Verify 'New Task' and 'New Note' icons on hover
- [ ] Summary of findings

## Findings
- The `open_browser_url` tool failed multiple times with the error: `failed to ensure valid context: failed to connect to browser via CDP (second attempt): failed to connect to browser via CDP even though the CDP port is responsive: http://127.0.0.1:9222: target closed: could not read protocol padding: EOF`.
- Tested `http://localhost:3000`, `http://127.0.0.1:3000`, and `https://google.com`, all failed with the same error.
- Unable to verify UI changes due to browser tool failure.
