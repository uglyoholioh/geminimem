# Walkthrough: Module Hub Layout Optimization

I have optimized the Module Hub to make better use of available space, allowing more modules to be visible at once and reducing unnecessary whitespace.

## Changes Made

### Compact Header and Stats Bar
- Reduced the font size and margins of the "Courses" header.
- Streamlined the stats bar by reducing padding, icon sizes, and shortening labels (e.g., "Active Modules" -> "Active").
- Compacted the search bar and "Active"/"All" toggle.

### Denser Course Grid
- Increased the number of columns:
    - **Desktop**: 4 columns (up from 3)
    - **Tablet/Medium**: 3 columns (up from 2)
    - **Mobile/Small**: 2 columns (up from 1, where appropriate)
- Reduced the gap between cards from `1rem` (gap-4) to `0.75rem` (gap-3).

### Streamlined Course Cards
- Reduced internal padding.
- Tightened typography and line heights.
- **Icon-only Footer**: The footer actions (Tasks, Notes, Canvas, Visibility) are now icon-only to save significant vertical space, while maintaining clear tooltips and hover states.
- The card title is now limited to a single line with an ellipsis to prevent varying card heights.

## Verification

### Code Review
- Verified that all interactive elements (search, toggle, buttons) retain their functionality and descriptive tooltips.
- Confirmed the responsive grid settings for various breakpoints.

## Optimized Layout Breakdown
- **Grid Layout**: `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3 lg:grid-cols-4`
- **Card Padding**: Reduced from `p-5` to `p-3.5`
- **Header Height**: Significantly reduced by tightening margins
