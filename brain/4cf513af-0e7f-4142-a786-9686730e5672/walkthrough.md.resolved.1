# Walkthrough: Module Hub Optimization

I have optimized the Module Hub (Courses page) to maximize space utilization and improve direct accessibility to common actions. The implementation was split into two phases: **Compact Layout** and **Quick Actions & Ultra-Compact View**.

## Changes Made

### Phase 1: Space Optimization
- **Header & Stats Bar**: Compacted the page header and the summary statistics cards, reducing vertical whitespace and making key metrics (Active, Assignments, Unread) more scannable.
- **Search & Filters**: Tightened the search bar and filter controls, ensuring they take up minimal space while remaining functional.
- **Grid Layout**: Increased the default grid density to `grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4 2xl:grid-cols-5`.

### Phase 2: Quick Actions & Ultra-Compact View
- **Hover Action Overlays**: Moved the main footer actions (Tasks, Notes, Canvas, Hide/Show, Recolour) into an overlay that appears only on hover. This significantly reduces the resting height of each card.
- **Direct Quick Adds**: Added "New Task" and "New Note" icon buttons directly to the card header (visible on hover) for one-click entry.
- **Typography & Polish**: Refined the module code chips, course titles (limited to one line), and added subtle hover animations (`-translate-y-0.5`).
- **Functionality Restoration**: Ensured the "Hide Module" (Visibility) toggle and "Recolour" picker are fully integrated into the new hover-based UI.

## Visual Improvements

The Module Hub now feels significantly more information-dense and "premium," allowing you to see 10+ modules at once on a standard 1080p screen without needing to scroll.

## Verification Results

- ✅ **Responsive Grid**: Verified that the columns adapt correctly from 2 to 5 based on screen width.
- ✅ **Hover Interactions**: Confirmed that action bars slide in smoothly and do not overlap adjacent cards.
- ✅ **Direct Actions**: Verified that "New Task" and "New Note" buttons correctly navigate with the appropriate query parameters.
- ✅ **Color Picker**: Confirmed the popover remains accessible and correctly updates the card color.
- ✅ **Active/Archived Logic**: Verified that hiding a module correctly moves it to the "Hidden Modules" section.

The Module Hub is now more efficient, faster to navigate, and visually cleaner!
