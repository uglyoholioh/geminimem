# Optimize Module Hub Space Utilization

The Goal is to make the Module Hub (Courses page) more compact and efficient with space, allowing more modules to be visible at once and reducing unnecessary whitespace.

## Proposed Changes

### Frontend Layout

#### [MODIFY] [page.tsx](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/app/courses/page.tsx)

- **Header Section**: Reduce the bottom margin and possibly move the "Courses" title and description into a more compact format.
- **Stats Bar**:
    - Change from a 3-column grid to a more flexible layout or reduce the padding and height of each stat card.
    - Reduce the icon sizes and font sizes slightly.
- **Search & Filter Bar**:
    - Reduce the vertical padding.
    - Consider placing the search bar and the "Active only" toggle on the same line as the stats or in a more compact arrangement.
- **Course Grid**:
    - Increase columns to `grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3 lg:grid-cols-4` to show more cards per row.
    - Reduce the gap between cards from `gap-4` to `gap-3`.
## Phase 2: Quick Actions & Ultra-Compact View

### Frontend Adjustments

#### [MODIFY] [page.tsx](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/app/courses/page.tsx)

- **Grid Density**:
    - Push desktop grid to `grid-cols-5` if the screen is wide enough (`2xl:grid-cols-5`).
    - Standard desktop `lg:grid-cols-4`.
- **Course Card Quick Actions**:
    - **Hover Overlay**: Instead of always showing the footer row, show it on hover to reduce visual clutter and vertical height when browsing.
    - **Quick Add**: Add icons for "New Task" and "New Note" directly on the card for instant action.
    - **Compact Meta**: Combine module code and name more efficiently.
- **Micro-Animations**: Add subtle scale or lift on hover to make the high-density grid feel interactive and not flat.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
1.  **Check Density**: Verify that at least 8-10 cards are visible on a standard 1080p screen without scrolling.
2.  **Quick Action Flow**: Hover over a card and ensure the action bar appears smoothly.
3.  **Navigation**: Ensure "New Task" and "New Note" (if implemented as quick links) lead to the correct filtered views or modals.
4.  **Clutter Check**: Ensure text is still legible and icons are distinguishable.
