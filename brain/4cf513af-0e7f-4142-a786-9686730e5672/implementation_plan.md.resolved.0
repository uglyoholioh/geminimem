# Optimize Module Hub Space Utilization

The Goal is to make the Module Hub (Courses page) more compact and efficient with space, allowing more modules to be visible at once and reducing unnecessary whitespace.

## Proposed Changes

### Frontend Layout

#### [MODIFY] [page.tsx](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/app/courses/page.tsx)

- **Header Section**: Reduce the bottom margin and possibly move the "Courses" title and description into a more compact format.
- **Stats Bar**:
    - Change from a 3-column grid to a more flexible layout or reduce the padding and height of each stat card.
    - Reduce the icon sizes and font sizes slightly.
- **Search & Filter Bar**:
    - Reduce the vertical padding.
    - Consider placing the search bar and the "Active only" toggle on the same line as the stats or in a more compact arrangement.
- **Course Grid**:
    - Increase columns to `grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3 lg:grid-cols-4` to show more cards per row.
    - Reduce the gap between cards from `gap-4` to `gap-3`.
- **Course Card Component**:
    - Reduce internal padding from `p-5` to `p-4`.
    - Compact the footer actions (Tasks, Notes, Canvas, Hide/Show).
    - Reduce the height of the "Colour Stripe".
    - Tighten typography (reduce line heights and margins).

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
1.  **Visual Inspection**: Open the `/courses` page in the browser and verify that more modules are visible on the screen without scrolling.
2.  **Responsiveness**: Resize the browser window to ensure the 4-column layout (on large screens) and 3-column layout (on medium screens) work correctly.
3.  **Functionality Check**:
    - Verify that clicking "Tasks", "Notes", and "Canvas" still works as expected.
    - Verify that the "Hide/Show" toggle and the "Active only" filter still function.
    - Verify that the color picker still opens and works correctly.
    - Verify search functionality.
