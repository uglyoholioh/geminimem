# Task System Upgrade Walkthrough

The task management system has been completely overhauled with a premium, responsive UI and a robust backend. Here is a demonstration of the new features.

## 🗂️ Task Views & Sidebar
A new sidebar provides quick navigation between various task perspectives.

- **Inbox**: Your default landing area for new tasks.
- **Today & Upcoming**: Tasks grouped chronologically to help you plan.
- **By Module**: Automatic grouping of tasks by their course code for academic focus.
- **Completed**: A retrospective view of all finished work.

## 📝 Task Creation & Detail Control
Creating and managing tasks is now more intuitive with dual-mode creation and a rich detail panel.

- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Press `N` to quickly open the creation modal.
- **Detail Panel**: Edit titles inline, add rich markdown notes, manage tags, and pick modules/dates with ease.
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes save instantly with optimistic UI updates for a snappy feel.

## 🔄 Canvas Auto-Tasking
You can now toggle automatic task creation from Canvas assignments.

When enabled, any new assignment synced from Canvas will automatically appear in your **Inbox**, pre-populated with the due date and module information.

## ✅ Verification Results
- **Backend Stability**: Fixed all 500 errors and standardized the database schema (merged `course_id` into `course_code` for consistency).
- **Persistence**: Verified that settings (like the Canvas toggle) and task edits (notes, priority) persist correctly after page reloads.
- **E2E Flow**: Confirmed the full lifecycle: Create → View → Edit → Complete.

**The system is now fully upgraded and ready for use.**
