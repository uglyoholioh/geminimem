## Completed Work

1. **Removed Grade Estimates and Completion Rates**
   - Removed the "Completion" and "Grade Estimate" stat cards from the module's Overview tab.
   - Removed the overall grade estimate display from the module's Grades tab.
   - Removed the Grade summary block from the top of the module's "Module Brief" tab.

2. **Added Knowledge Base Schedule View**
   - Implemented a new section in the "Module Brief" tab to automatically query the AI and extract a learning schedule based on all user-uploaded knowledge base files for the course.
   - The AI uses a targeted `extract_schedule` task type to focus specifically on schedules without conversational filler.
   - If the uploaded text doesn't contain a clear schedule, or no files are uploaded, a polished message is shown encouraging the user to upload their module syllabus or outlines to enable this feature.
