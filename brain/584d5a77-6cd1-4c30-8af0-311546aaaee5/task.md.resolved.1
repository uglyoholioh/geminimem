# Fix Timetable Import Display Issue

- [x] Investigate root cause of empty timetable after import
- [x] Write implementation plan
- [x] Add `total_slots` count to backend `/week` endpoint
- [x] Update frontend to differentiate empty states (no imports vs no classes this week)
- [x] Add recess/non-teaching week banner
- [x] After import, auto-navigate to nearest teaching week
- [/] Verify with tests and browser
