# Include User Name in Dashboard Greeting

This change will personalize the dashboard greeting by including the user's display name.

## Proposed Changes

### Frontend

#### [MODIFY] [page.tsx](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/app/page.tsx)
- Import [useAuth](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/components/AuthProvider.tsx#29-34) from `@/components/AuthProvider`.
- Get the [user](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/backend/routers/auth.py#44-63) object from [useAuth()](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/components/AuthProvider.tsx#29-34).
- Update the greeting `h1` to include `user?.display_name`.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
- Log in to the application.
- Navigate to the dashboard.
- Verify that the greeting shows "Good morning, [Name]", "Good afternoon, [Name]", or "Good evening, [Name]".
- Change the display name in Settings and verify the dashboard update.

### Automated Tests
- I will run the existing Playwright tests to ensure no regressions.
- `npx playwright test e2e/auth.spec.ts`
