# Pure Transparency Logo Redesign

I've explored why the logo still shows a white background. To solve this permanently, I'll transition the UI logos to **SVG format**. SVGs provide perfect transparency, sharp lines at any zoom, and predictable rendering across all browsers. I'll also regenerate the favicon with stricter transparency constraints.

## Proposed "Retro Pixel" & SVG Approach

We will keep the retro theme but implement it as an SVG component for the in-app logos to ensure zero background artifacts.

1. **SVG Sidebar Logo**: Replace the "OS" text in the Sidebar with a custom SVG book icon.
2. **SVG Login Logo**: Replace the Lucide `GraduationCap` with our brand-consistent SVG logo.
3. **Cleaned Favicon**: A high-contrast PNG favicon optimized for browser tabs.

## User Review Required

> [!IMPORTANT]
> I am moving from PNG to SVG for the main interface logos to eliminate any transparency issues. SVGs are inherently transparent and will look much more "premium" and sharp.

## Proposed Changes

### [Component: Frontend Assets]

Summary: Replace PNG logos with SVG components and update the favicon.

#### [NEW] [Logo.tsx](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/components/Logo.tsx)
#### [MODIFY] [Sidebar.tsx](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx)
#### [MODIFY] [page.tsx](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/app/login/page.tsx)
#### [MODIFY] [favicon.png](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/public/favicon.png)
#### [MODIFY] [logo.png](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/public/logo.png)

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
1.  **Tab Test**: Verify the icon in the browser tab has zero white ghosting.
2.  **In-App Scaling**: Check that the SVG logo looks crisp in both the Sidebar and Login pages.
3.  **Dark/Light Mode**: Confirm the logo remains clearly visible in both themes.
