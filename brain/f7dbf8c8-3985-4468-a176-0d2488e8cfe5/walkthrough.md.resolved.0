# Walkthrough - Logo Redesign

I have modernized the visual identity of "Academic Life OS" by replacing the generic logo and tab icon with a minimal, premium design.

## Changes Made

### Frontend Assets
- Replaced [logo.png](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/public/logo.png) with a new glassmorphic design.
- Replaced [favicon.png](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/public/favicon.png) with the same design to ensure consistency in the browser tab.

## Selection

The "Glassmorphic A" variant was chosen for its modern aesthetic and clever combination of academic symbols (book and pen nib).

## Verification Results

| Step | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| File Replacement | ✅ Success | Commands executed successfully. |
| Tab Icon Update | ✅ Success | [layout.tsx](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/app/layout.tsx) already points to [/favicon.png](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/public/favicon.png). |
| Logo Consistency | ✅ Success | Both [logo.png](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/public/logo.png) and [favicon.png](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/public/favicon.png) are now identical high-quality assets. |

> [!TIP]
> You may need to hard-refresh your browser (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+F5) to see the new favicon in your tab as browsers often cache these heavily.
