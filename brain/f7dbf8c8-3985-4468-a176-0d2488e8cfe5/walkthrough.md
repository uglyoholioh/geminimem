# Walkthrough - Retro Pixel Art Logo Redesign

I have updated the visual identity of "Academic Life OS" with a flat, retro pixel art book icon. This design fulfills the request for a clean, 2D aesthetic with no glow effects or aura.

## Changes Made

### Frontend Assets
- **Logo & Favicon**: Replaced `logo.png` and `favicon.png` in the `public` directory with the "Starry Green Book" design.
- **Transparency**: The new asset features a pure transparent background, ensuring it blends perfectly into any browser tab theme.
- **Aesthetic**: Committed to a flat 16-bit style with solid opaque colors and zero lighting effects.

## Final Design

The **Starry Green Book** was selected for its classic retro-gaming vibe and representation of academic success.
