# Walkthrough - Gen Z Logo Redesign

I have updated the visual identity of "Academic Life OS" with a bold, "Gen Z" inspired Neubrutalist design. This replaces the previous glassmorphic version and resolves the white background issue.

## Changes Made

### Frontend Assets
- **Logo & Favicon**: Replaced [logo.png](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/public/logo.png) and [favicon.png](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/public/favicon.png) in the `public` directory with a high-contrast Neubrutalist "A" design.
- **Transparency**: The new asset is designed on a pure transparent background, ensuring it looks sharp in both light and dark browser tabs.

## Final Design

The **Neubrutalist A** was selected for its bold outlines and vibrant energy.
