# Observations
- Home: Modern dashboard with a three-column layout. Sidebar on the left with icon-based navigation. "Command Center" in the middle for AI interactions. "Today's Agenda" and "Module Hub" on the right. Dark mode is sleek but some areas feel empty without data.
- Login: Simple, centered login card with email and password fields. Clean branding.
- Tasks: Kanban board interface (Inbox, In Progress, Completed). Top bar has search and filters. Sidebar for task categories. Works well but filler tasks like "Debug Task" are visible.
- Timetable: Informative header with date range and class count. "Recess Week" message is a great UX detail. Tools for importing (ICS/NUSMods) are prominent.
- Assignments: List-based view with clear module tags. "Action Needed" section highlights overdue items in red. Search and filtering system seems robust.
- Focus: Clean Pomodoro timer with a background gradient/glow. "Focusing On" and "Up Next" sections keep the user on track.
- Settings: Comprehensive settings with a sub-sidebar. Covers profile, notifications, appearance, and AI context.

# Critical Evaluation & Suggestions
- Empty States: Many components (Agenda, Command Center) look a bit barren when empty. Suggest adding "Quick Start" tips or placeholder illustrations.
- Navigation Consistency: The Settings page uses a different sub-navigation style compared to the main app sidebar.
- Accessibility: Dark mode contrast in some areas (like the focus timer or small text in Module Hub) might need checking.
- Integration: Direct navigation from a task to a focus session could be tighter.
- Mobile View: The three-column dashboard might be challenging on smaller screens.
