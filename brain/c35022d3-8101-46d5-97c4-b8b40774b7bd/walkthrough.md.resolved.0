# Walkthrough: Initial Security & UX Overhaul

This walkthrough demonstrates the first set of completed improvements for CraftCanvas, focusing on security, assignment accuracy, and dashboard utility during off-peak periods like recess week.

## Completed Features

### 1. API Security Enhancement (Plan 3)
We've implemented Next.js rewrites to proxy all `/api/v1/*` requests to the backend. This allows us to remove the `X-API-Key` from the client-side bundle entirely, preventing accidental exposure of your Canvas integration secrets.

### 2. Assignment Accuracy & "Wall of Red" Fix (Plan 1)
- **Auto-Status Promotion**: The backend now fetches submission data from Canvas. If an assignment is submitted or graded on Canvas, CraftCanvas automatically updates its status to `submitted` or `graded`, removing it from your "overdue" list.
- **Improved Grouping**: Assignments reflect a more logical chronological structure, grouped by the week they are due.
- **Progress Tracking**: A new semester progress meter at the top of the Assignments page shows your overall completion rate across all modules.
- **Default Focus**: Submitted and graded assignments are hidden by default to keep you focused on what's next. You can still toggle them on via the "Show Submitted" button.

### 3. Dashboard Resiliency (Plan 2)
The dashboard is no longer empty during breaks or quiet days:
- **7-Day Lookahead**: If today is empty, the dashboard automatically scans the next 7 days for the next scheduled activity to keep you informed of upcoming sessions.
- **Mini-Brief Summary**: When a full AI brief hasn't been generated, a contextual one-line summary (e.g., "You have 3 unread announcements and 2 assignments due soon") is displayed instead of a generic "No brief" message.
- **Configurable View**: You can now manually switch the dashboard lookahead between Today, 3 Days, and 1 Week using the selector in the Command Center.

## Verification Results

- [x] **Build Verification**: Production build succeeded with all changes.
- [x] **Logic Verification**: Backend [canvas_sync](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/backend/jobs/scheduler.py#47-73) successfully processes `submission` objects.
- [x] **UI Verification**: Dashboard lookahead correctly identifies next available slot; Assignments page grouping and progress meter are functional.
