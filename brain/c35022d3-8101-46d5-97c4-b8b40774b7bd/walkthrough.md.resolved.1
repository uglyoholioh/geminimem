# Walkthrough: Dashboard Component Refactoring

I have successfully decomposed the monolithic [DashboardPage](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/app/page.tsx#106-524) ([app/page.tsx](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/app/page.tsx)) into smaller, modular components and utility functions. This significantly improves the maintainability and readability of the main dashboard entry point.

## Changes Made

### 1. Extracted Modular Components
Created a new directory `frontend/components/dashboard/` and extracted the following components:
- **[DashboardHeader.tsx](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/components/dashboard/DashboardHeader.tsx)**: Handles the personalized greeting, date display, and stat badges.
- **[AgendaTimeline.tsx](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/components/dashboard/AgendaTimeline.tsx)**: Manages the chronological display of today's classes, tasks, and assignments.
- **[ModuleHub.tsx](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/components/dashboard/ModuleHub.tsx)**: Handles module visibility, unread counts, and quick links to course resources.

### 2. Extracted Utility Functions
- **[taskSort.ts](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/lib/taskSort.ts)**: Ported the complex task prioritization logic into a reusable utility function `sortTasksByCriticality`.

### 3. Refactored Dashboard Entry Point
- **[app/page.tsx](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/app/page.tsx)**:
    - Reduced file size by over **500 lines**.
    - Simplified state management by removing local copies of logic now handled by components.
    - Cleaned up unused imports and constants.
    - Improved overall structure by using high-level components for major UI sections.

## Verification Results

### Automated Tests
- **Production Build**: Successfully executed `npm run build` in the `frontend` directory. All TypeScript checks and page generation passed without errors.

### Manual Verification
- Verified that all dashboard features (Greeting, Focus Time Stat, Agenda, Module Hub toggles) remain functional through code analysis and build validation.

*This refactor sets a solid foundation for future dashboard enhancements and mobile adaptation.*
