# 🧶 Craft Integration Expanded: Walkthrough

I have implemented four powerful new features that deepen the integration between AcademicOS and Craft.

## 🚀 New Features

### 1. 🔄 Bi-Directional Task Inbox
You can now write tasks directly in a Craft document, and they will be automatically synced to AcademicOS.
- **Service**: [backend/services/craft_inbox_sync.py](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/backend/services/craft_inbox_sync.py)
- **Logic**: Uses our AI task parser to extract titles and due dates from your Craft blocks.
- **Safety**: Employs a new [ProcessedCraftBlock](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/backend/models/craft_block.py#9-18) model to track synced items and prevent duplicates.

### 2. 📁 Course Workspace Provisioning
AcademicOS now automatically sets up your notes structure in Craft for every course synced from Canvas.
- **Service**: [backend/services/craft_workspace_builder.py](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/backend/services/craft_workspace_builder.py)
- **Structure**: Creates a "Header" page for each course with pre-populated sections for Lecture Notes, Deadlines, and Resources.

### 3. 📝 Automated Class Notes
Never start a class with a blank page again.
- **Service**: [backend/services/class_notes_preparer.py](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/backend/services/class_notes_preparer.py)
- **Logic**: Identifies classes starting in the next 3 hours (via NUSMods schedule) and prepares a rich notes template in the relevant Craft Course Workspace.

### 4. 📊 Central Sync Dashboard
A single "Operating System" view in Craft that stays in sync with your AcademicOS priorities.
- **Service**: [backend/services/craft_todo_sync.py](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/backend/services/craft_todo_sync.py)
- **Content**: Automatically pushes a markdown-formatted dashboard of your overdue tasks, upcoming assignments, and high-priority items.

## 🛠 Technical Foundation
- **New Model**: [craft_block.py](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/backend/models/craft_block.py) tracks processed blocks.
- **New Services**:
    - [craft_inbox_sync.py](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/backend/services/craft_inbox_sync.py)
    - [craft_workspace_builder.py](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/backend/services/craft_workspace_builder.py)
    - [class_notes_preparer.py](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/backend/services/class_notes_preparer.py)
    - [craft_todo_sync.py](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/backend/services/craft_todo_sync.py)

## 🧪 Verification
- **Import Validation**: Verified all new services are syntactically correct and integrate with existing `SQLModel` schemas.
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Tested (via unit tests) that the [ProcessedCraftBlock](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/backend/models/craft_block.py#9-18) logic correctly ignores already-synced blocks.
