# 🎨 Expanding the Craft Integration

Craft is more than just a place for the Daily Brief; it can become the primary "operating system" for your academic life, while CraftCanvas handles the heavy lifting of data sync and AI processing.

Here are 5 ways we can level up the integration:

## 1. 🔄 Bi-Directional Task Inbox
**The Idea**: Create a "Task Sync" document in Craft. Any block you add there (via mobile, desktop, or quick capture) gets automatically imported into CraftCanvas as a new task.
- **Why**: You spend a lot of time in Craft. Capturing tasks there should be the default, not an extra step.
- **How**: We poll the "Task Inbox" document periodically and parse new blocks using our AI task parser.

## 2. 📁 Module Workspaces (Auto-Provisioning)
**The Idea**: When a new course is synced from Canvas, CraftCanvas automatically sets up a rich module workspace in Craft.
- **Structure**:
  - `[CS2103T] Software Engineering` (Folder)
    - `Lecture Notes` (Sub-page)
    - `Assignments` (Sub-page, synced with Canvas deadlines)
    - `Announcements Archive`
- **Why**: Keeps your notes organized by course without manual setup.

## 3. 📝 Automated Meeting & Class Notes
**The Idea**: Before every lecture or tutorial (from your NUSMods schedule), CraftCanvas prepares a "Meeting Note" in Craft.
- **Content**: Pre-populated with the lecture title, date, venue, and a "Questions for Professor" section.
- **Why**: Eliminates "blank page syndrome" right as class starts.

## 4. 📊 Weekly Academic Reviews
**The Idea**: Every Sunday, CraftCanvas pushes a "Weekly Review" page to a dedicated folder.
- **Content**: 
  - Accomplishments this week (completed tasks).
  - High-priority deadlines for the *next* two weeks.
  - A "Reflection" block where you can write about your progress.
- **Why**: Encourages consistent planning and reflection.

## 6. 📈 Grade Tracker & Goal Sync
**The Idea**: Automatically push your current Canvas grades and target GPA progress to a visual dashboard in Craft.
- **Why**: Keeps your academic goals front-and-center in your notes app without manually checking Canvas.

## 7. 📚 AI-Generated Study Guides
**The Idea**: AcademicOS parses your `Lecture Notes` blocks in Craft and generates a consolidated "Study Guide" or "Cheat Sheet" page before major exams.
- **Why**: Leverages your actual notes to create personalized revision material.

## 8. ⏲️ Focus Session Logging
**The Idea**: When you complete a "Focus Session" in AcademicOS, it logs the time spent, task names, and productivity rating into a "Daily Habit Tracker" doc in Craft.
- **Why**: Perfect for building a historical record of your focus habits.

## 9. 🎓 Smart Archive & Export
**The Idea**: At the end of the semester, AcademicOS bundles your entire folder structure into a permanent "Archive" folder and generates a PDF summary of your semester's accomplishments.
- **Why**: Keeps your workspace clean for the next term while preserving your hard work.

## 10. 📣 Announcement Hub
**The Idea**: A course-specific page that lists all Canvas announcements, with AI-driven "Bottom Line" summaries clarifying how each update affects your specific deadlines.
- **Why**: Reduces information overload from university announcements.

## 11. 📚 Reading List & Resource Parser
**The Idea**: AcademicOS extracts all "Required Reading" links and PDF names from Canvas and builds a central "Reading List" doc in Craft.
- **Why**: You can track what you've read and draft summaries directly in the same document.

## 12. 🃏 AI Flashcard Generation
**The Idea**: AcademicOS "reads" your `Lecture Notes` section and creates a "Review" sub-page with AI-generated flashcard questions based on the content.
- **Why**: Speeds up the transition from "notetaking" to "memorizing."

## 13. 🗺️ Campus Venue Deep-Linking
**The Idea**: Your Class Note templates in Craft now include a "Directions" block with deep-links to the NUS internal maps for tricky lecture hall locations.
- **Why**: Saves that 5-minute frantic search for a new tutorial room.

## 14. 🎤 Voice Capture Sync
**The Idea**: If you record a quick thought via voice on Craft mobile, AcademicOS parses the transcript for deadlines or "Questions for Prof" and adds them to the right dashboard.
- **Why**: True "quick capture" that doesn't require typing.

## 15. 🔗 Concept Mapping (Cross-Course)
**The Idea**: AcademicOS identifies shared keywords between notes in different modules (e.g., "Linear Algebra" appearing in both CS and Engineering) and adds "See also" links in Craft.
- **Why**: Helps you build a more integrated understanding of your major.

> **What's the goal?** We want Craft to be the place where you **think**, while AcademicOS handles all the **administration** and **AI processing**.
