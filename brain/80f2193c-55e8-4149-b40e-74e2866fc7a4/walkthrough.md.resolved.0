# Walkthrough - Optional Task Date and Time

I have made it optional to add a date and time when creating or editing tasks.

## Changes Made

### Frontend
- **InlineTaskCreator**:
    - Removed default date (today) and time (current hour) from the task creator.
    - Updated the submission logic to send `null` for `due_date` and `due_time` if they are not specified.
- **TaskDetail**:
    - Updated the save logic to correctly send `null` when date or time fields are cleared.

### Backend
- Verified that the backend already supports optional `due_date` and `due_time` fields.
- Existing tests confirm that tasks can be created and listed without these fields.

## Verification Results

### Automated Tests
- Ran backend router tests: `pytest backend/tests/test_routers/test_tasks.py`
- Result: `5 passed` (including tasks with and without dates).

### Manual Verification (Expected Behavior)
- When adding a task, the date and time fields will now be empty by default.
- If you don't select a date, the task will appear in the "No due date" section of the task list.
- You can clear a date/time from an existing task in the detail panel by deleting the value and saving.
