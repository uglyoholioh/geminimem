# Walkthrough - Simplified Optional Deadlines

I have implemented a simplified "Deadline Toggle" to make it easier to add or remove dates and times for tasks.

## Changes Made

### Frontend
- **InlineTaskCreator**:
    - Replaced individual "Clear" buttons with a single **"Has Deadline / No Deadline"** toggle.
    - When "No Deadline" is selected, the task is created without any date or time.
    - When "Has Deadline" is selected, it pre-fills with today's date and the current hour, which can still be adjusted using the `+1d`, `+1w` etc. shortcuts.
- **TaskDetail**:
    - Added a **"Set Deadline / Clear Deadline"** button at the top of the date section. This provides a one-click way to remove dates from an existing task.

### Backend
- Verified that the backend correctly handles tasks created with or without deadlines.
- All existing task management tests are passing.

## Verification Results

### Automated Tests
- Ran backend router tests: `pytest backend/tests/test_routers/test_tasks.py`
- Result: `5 passed`.

### Manual Verification (Expected Behavior)
- **Adding a Task**: By default, "Has Deadline" is on. Click it to switch to "No Deadline" instantly.
- **Editing a Task**: Open the task details and click "Clear Deadline" to remove all date metadata at once. Click "Set Deadline" to re-add defaults for editing.
