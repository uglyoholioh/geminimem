# Make task date and time optional

The user wants to make the date and time fields optional when adding or editing tasks. Currently, the UI might be enforcing these fields or defaulting them in a way that makes them seem required.

## Proposed Changes

### [Component Name] Frontend

#### [MODIFY] [page.tsx](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/app/tasks/page.tsx)
- **InlineTaskCreator**:
    - Add a `hasDeadline` state (boolean).
    - If `hasDeadline` is false, hide the date/time adjustment controls and send `null` for `due_date`/`due_time`.
    - If `hasDeadline` is true, show pre-filled date/time controls.
    - Default `hasDeadline` to `true` but allow one-click toggling.
- **TaskDetail**:
    - Add a "No due date" toggle at the top of the date/time section.
    - Simplifies the UI by hiding specific inputs when a task is intended to be un-dated.

### [Component Name] Backend

#### [MODIFY] [test_tasks.py](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/backend/tests/test_routers/test_tasks.py)
- Add a test case `test_create_task_without_date` to verify that the backend handles task creation without a due date correctly.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- Run backend tests: `pytest backend/tests/test_routers/test_tasks.py`
- Run frontend tests (if applicable): `npm test` in `frontend` directory.

### Manual Verification
- Open the application and navigate to the Tasks page.
- Try adding a task using the [InlineTaskCreator](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/app/tasks/page.tsx#154-417) without selecting a date or time.
- Verify the task is created and displayed correctly in the "No date" group.
- Open the detail panel for a task with a date and clear the date and time.
- Save and verify the changes persist.
