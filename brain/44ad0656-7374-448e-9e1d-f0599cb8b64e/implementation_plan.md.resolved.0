# Courses Tab Redesign — LMS Manager Style

Redesign the courses listing and detail pages with richer card-based UI, colour-coded modules, and polished design matching the LMS Manager / Activity Finder style. The timetable already uses `course_colour` so we'll ensure consistency.

## Proposed Changes

### Courses Listing

#### [MODIFY] [page.tsx](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/app/courses/page.tsx)

**Header section:**
- Add a summary bar: total modules, upcoming deadlines count, overall assignment progress ring
- Add a search/filter input to filter modules by code or name
- Toggle to show archived/inactive courses

**Card redesign (inspired by Activity Finder cards):**
- Thick left colour stripe (4px) using module `colour` instead of thin top bar
- Card body: module code badge in a chip using module colour background, full course name, term label
- Mid-section: assignment count, unread announcements, next deadline
- Bottom footer row (border-t) with two quick-action buttons: "Open in Canvas" and a "View Details" arrow — matching the Activity Finder card footer pattern
- Hover: `hover:border-{colour}/50`, title colour transition, subtle shadow lift
- Progress bar for assignment completion inside each card

**Empty state:**
- More prominent illustration area with call-to-action to set up Canvas sync

---

### Course Detail Page

#### [MODIFY] [page.tsx](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/app/courses/%5Bid%5D/page.tsx)

**Header:**
- Use module colour as gradient background band (not just a 1.5px line) — a 48px tall gradient from `colour → transparent`
- Module code chip with coloured background badge

**Stat cards:**
- Use module colour as accent on each stat card (left stripe or subtle bg tint)
- Add a circular progress ring for the completion percentage card

**Assignments tab:**
- Group by status with collapsible sections
- Better visual status indicators with coloured dots/tags

**Schedule tab:**
- Colour the schedule rows with module colour accent

---

### Timetable Colour Consistency

#### [MODIFY] [page.tsx](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/app/timetable/page.tsx)

- The timetable already uses `slot.course_colour` for block fills — no changes needed unless the backend colour values change. The colours will be consistent because they come from the same `course.colour` field.

---

### Backend — No Changes Needed

The backend already returns `colour`, `canvas_url`, `assignment_count`, `unread_announcement_count`, `last_synced_at`, and all the data we need. No backend modifications required.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
1. Start the dev server (`npm run dev` in `frontend/`)
2. Navigate to [/courses](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/app/courses) — verify:
   - Cards display with left colour stripe matching module colour
   - Search input filters modules by code/name
   - Summary stats bar shows correctly
   - Hover effects work (border colour change, title accent, shadow)
   - Footer buttons (Canvas link, arrow) are visible and functional
   - Progress bar shows inside each card
3. Click a course card → navigate to `/courses/[id]` — verify:
   - Header has gradient colour band
   - Stat cards show module colour accents
   - All tabs (Overview, Assignments, Announcements, Grades, Schedule) function correctly
   - Schedule rows use module colour
4. Navigate to `/timetable` — verify timetable blocks still use correct module colours
5. Toggle dark mode — all colours should look correct in both themes
