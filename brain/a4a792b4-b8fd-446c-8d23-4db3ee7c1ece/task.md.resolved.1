# Onboarding Revamp — User Categorisation + Module Verification

## Backend
- [x] Add `user_type` field to User model (e.g. `"standard"` / `"technical"`)
- [x] Add `PATCH /courses/{id}` endpoint to toggle `is_active` on courses
- [x] Add `PATCH /courses/bulk-active` endpoint to bulk-update `is_active` for multiple courses
- [x] Add endpoint to return synced courses for verification during onboarding

## Frontend — Setup Page
- [x] Add Step 0: User type selection (Standard vs Technical/Power User)
- [x] Make Canvas API step mandatory (remove "Skip" button)
- [x] After Canvas validation, trigger sync and show module verification step
- [x] Module verification step: list synced courses with checkboxes for active/inactive
- [x] Conditionally show Craft + Telegram steps only for "Technical" user type
- [x] Update step indicators for dynamic step count
- [x] Update final "Finish Setup" to save module active states

## Frontend — Courses Page
- [x] Courses page already has active/archived toggle — ensure it works with module verification

## Verification
- [ ] Browser test: walk through the full onboarding flow
- [ ] Verify courses page reflects active/inactive state
