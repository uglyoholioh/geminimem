# Walkthrough: Meeting Finder Fixes

I have implemented fixes for the Meeting Finder to ensure consistent behavior across the frontend and backend.

## Changes Made

### backend/routers/meetings.py
- Added validation for the meeting time range: `time_range_start` must now be before `time_range_end`.
- Added documentation to [ProposalCreate](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/backend/routers/meetings.py#37-43) specifying that `day_of_week` follows the 0=Monday convention.

### frontend/components/meetings/AvailabilityGrid.tsx
- **Robust Date Range Logic**: Refactored `visibleDays` (now `visibleDates`) to correctly iterate through every date in the specified range.
- **Day-of-Week Normalization**: Standardized the mapping of `date-fns` results (where 0=Sunday) to match the backend's convention (where 0=Monday).
- **Type Safety**: Added explicit types for map parameters and resolved all relevant lint errors.

## Verification Results

### Backend Verification
Ran [repro_meeting.py](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/backend/repro_meeting.py) which confirms:
- Meetings are correctly created with tokens.
- Participants and proposals store the correct `day_of_week` (0 for Monday).

### Frontend Verification
- Verified that the grid now correctly shows all dates in a range, even when spanning multiple weeks.
- Verified that the "Today" highlighting and day labels remain accurate under the new normalization.
