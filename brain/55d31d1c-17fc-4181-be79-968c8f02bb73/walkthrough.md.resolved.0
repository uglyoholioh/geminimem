# Tasks Page Revamp & Timetable Integration

The Tasks feature has been completely rebuilt to focus on manual, structured entry while retaining the beautiful terminal aesthetic. We've also successfully bridged tasks with the Timetable view.

## What Changed?

### 1. Backend Simplification
The task creation pipeline has been cleaned up significantly. The natural language processing (NLP) logic has been removed from the create route, and the task models have been streamlined. The [models/task.py](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/backend/models/task.py) and [routers/tasks.py](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/backend/routers/tasks.py) now directly link tasks to modules using `course_code`, improving data integrity and resolving duplication issues.

### 2. Frontend: New Tasks Page
The [app/tasks/page.tsx](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/app/tasks/page.tsx) was fully rewritten from the ground up:
*   **Inline Creator**: Gone is the modal! You can now add tasks instantly via an inline textbox at the top of the list, complete with quick-tag pills for module, priority, due date, and tags.
*   **Powerful Filtering**: A new search bar and dynamic priority filter pills (Low, Med, High, !!!) have been added to the header. Active filters appear as dismissible chips.
*   **Multiple Views**: We retained the List, Kanban Board, and Calendar views, and introduced a brand new **Timeline** view for the "Upcoming" tasks, which groups items chronologically.
*   **Sidebar Refinements**: The "By Module" view now displays clickable module colour pills in the sidebar for quick filtering.

### 3. Timetable Integration
Tasks have been brought into the timetable:
*   **Toggle Switch**: A new "Tasks" button with a checkbox icon sits in the timetable header controls. Clicking it overlays task deadlines directly onto the grid.
*   **Visual Markers**: Deadlines appear as small strips directly in the timetable views (under the day labels horizontally, or pinned to the bottom vertically). High-priority tasks flash the urgency colour, while normal tasks use the module's accent colour.
*   **Persistent Preference**: The "Show Tasks" toggle state is saved to your account settings via the backend [settings](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/backend/routers/settings.py#25-33) API, meaning your preference persists across sessions and devices.

> [!TIP]
> Try using the comma-separated `tags` input in the new inline creator to quickly attach multiple labels to a task before hitting Enter!
