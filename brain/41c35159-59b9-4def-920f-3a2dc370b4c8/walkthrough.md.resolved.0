# Walkthrough - Preset Task Tags

I have implemented preset task tags to streamline task creation and organization.

## Changes Made

### Backend
- **Settings API**: Updated the settings router to provide a default list of `preset_tags` if they are not already defined by the user.
- **Default Tags**: Included "Revision", "Assignment", "Reading", "Lecture", "Urgent", "Project", and "Research" as initial presets.

### Frontend
- **Tasks Page**: Now fetches `preset_tags` from the settings API on load.
- **Inline Task Creator**: Added a row of preset tag pills. Clicking a pill toggles the tag in the input field.
- **Task Detail Panel**: Added a section under the Tags input with preset tag pills for quick selection.
- **UI Improvements**: Adjusted the layout of the tag input in the creator to accommodate preset pills without cluttering the interface.

## Verification Results

### Backend Verification
- Verified that `GET /api/v1/settings` returns the default `preset_tags` JSON string for new users or if the key is missing.

### Frontend Verification
- Verified that preset tags appear in the [InlineTaskCreator](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/app/tasks/page.tsx#138-364).
- Verified that clicking a preset tag pill correctly adds/removes it from the comma-separated tag input.
- Verified that the same logic works correctly in the [TaskDetail](file:///Users/oli/Desktop/CraftCanvas/frontend/app/tasks/page.tsx#512-879) panel.
- Verified that tasks are saved with the selected tags.

## Visuals
(Note: Screenshots would be here in a real deployment scenario. The pills appear as small mono-spaced badges under the tag input.)
